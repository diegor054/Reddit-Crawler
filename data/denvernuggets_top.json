Got to watch Timelord working on his shot pre-game with just an assistant. lots of good stuff. \n\nDespite the outcome, it was yet another good time visiting the Pepsi Center. The time before the Celtics won, so that softened the blow, but I still hooked my daughter up with some local swag. Got her a Stuffed Rocky Doll, and an Under Armour Nuggets Fleece from the gift shop. I bought the smallest size they had and I think she might just be big enough to wear it this year.

We don't need harris's defense like we did in the jazz/clips series. This has nothing to do with \"forgetting\" what he has done for us. Its annoying defending that. Yes, he has done great..that doesn't mean we should give him 32 minutes for 6 points. He needs to provide offense in this series, not just lockdown defense.  If harris isn't willing to shoot or make shots  it really hurts..just like last night during the zone.", "Do you not remember the Nuggets being utterly unable to keep the Jazz beneath 120 points before Gary came back? Before Gary's return, 4/4 playoff games we gave up 120+, vs. 2/12 games since he came back. \n\nGary is not in the game to score. He's in the game because he's the lynchpin of our perimeter defense. He has a massive effect on our bottom line at that end of the court and I think he's more than demonstrated that this postseason. Would I love for him to get more consistent at the offensive end? Sure, but at that point you're talking about an All-Star level player. He already brings a ton to the table for this team as-is.", "Doesn't mean I have to like every Nugget. He refused to learn how to play defense and the only lasting contributions he will have made to our franchise were getting a good coach (Bzdelik) fired, getting Chauncey traded, and subsequently giving us the pick swap that resulted in us drafting Jamal Murray.", "Seriously. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s recent nuggets fans, but most of the years between our last playoff appearance and drafting melo were absolute trash", "You\u2019re the one with the bias. ISO basketball is just bad basketball. The 00\u2019s had talented players but it was completely void of coaching and defense with exception to an old Spurs team and the Pistons. \n\nPhil Jackson\u2019s Lakers was a lot different from his Bulls team. The way he enabled Kobe to 1v5 the entire league was only possible from a lack of defense in league after the triangle offense dismantled the best defenses in the 90\u2019s. Phil didn\u2019t even have to coach his Lakers team, there was nobody that could compete with the pure talent on his team. \n\nMelo\u2019s coach on the Knicks was an idiot for condemning triangle offense because he didn\u2019t know when to use it, because it was only applicable to the very few teams that still played defense. \n\nAnd Melo is great and all individually, but he never exactly had his body in shape the way Lebron and Kobe did, so he wasn\u2019t going to win a ring riding on his pure talent alone enabled by ISO. He\u2019s somewhere between Haren and Lebron. \n\nThe result is Melo being enable to pad his stats while he contributed to setting a terrible example of how basketball should be played.", "Really? I had no idea, I thought Dort was all defense didn't hear much about him until he locked up Harden.  Regardless you guys have a really bright future and I'm stoked to see how things turn out", "Bro, I'm sorry but you have no eye for scouting talent. Dort is a nice player but he's nothing more than a fringe starter down the road.", "Shout out to the Canadian backcourt.", "The prophecy must be fulfilled. Nuggets in 7", "C C C COMBO BREAKER", "During the zone I agree we need to play more shooters. But I still think you are overlooking what Gary brings to the team on the defensive end. Its not just his individual defense, the overall team defensive intensity is night and day with him on/off the court. It is mainly him, JG, and Jokic providing that, and our defense is one of the big reasons we are doing well in this series so far.", "idk how many times I have to defend whta harris has done for this team vs the jazz/clipps. I completely understand and don't need to hear what he has done defensively against their best guards in mitchell/lou will/PG. I even was one of the defenders of harris against everyone yelling at him for not producing. \nIs this the same series as the jazz/clips thoug? No it isnt. He does great defensively but he isnt really asked to do what he has in previous series...which is to be a lynchpin on perimeter defense against specific guys. I counted 3-4 times where he passed up a shot by passing or driving it in. When he did drive it in he got blocked or kicked it out when the shot clock was down to 5 seconds and another player had to force a bad shot. He needs to start shooting and if he isn't, morris/dozier/mpj can provide some valuable minutes as well. Im not saying harris should not start or play at all. Im just saying 32 minutes of just 6 points hurts when harris isn't needed to really lock anythign down. He can be very valuable playing 25 min and doing the same thing. That 7 min can be used more effectively, is all I'm saying. Im not saying he isn't useful or hasn't helped at all in other series..", ">Gary is not in the game to score.\n\nthis is describing torey craig. Gary can score better than craig and is getting paid because he can shoot a lot better. He needs to get that stroke going", "You mean you don\u2019t like watching Kenneth Faried dunk 5 times a night?", "No way melo is even close to bron or Kobe, that's not what I'm saying. Just better than grant, at least for now.", "Both the rules were different and the officiating was different too. Illegal defenses for any partial zones. Hand checking called differently. I agree that more 3s should have been taken, as that would open up space...but Iso vall does have value. Kawhi isod his way to a trophy last year (not the only reason, but that is how he gets his points, and he does it effectively). It was literally a different age in the game and that mid range iso scoring was even more valuable. It was harder to get to the hoop on drives (again less spacing). He was a player of his time, but he was a top 5 offensive player for a decade.", "His defense is def the best part of his game right now, but he also scored 30 points on 10/21 shooting in game 7 v the rockets\n\nNot bad for an undrafted 21 year old I\u2019d say", "He scored 30 points on 10/21 shooting in a game 7 while also guarding James Harden.\n\nYou know nothing of Dort.", "God it\u2019s gonna be such a joy to watch them grow together", "and he can still doing that while not playing 35 minutes when he isn't scoring. all im saying is that he shouldn't play 35 min while scoring 6 points, 3 points, 7 points. Game 2 was a perfect usage. Dozier got those minutes and played great. morris could've gotten them as he was playing great. Ride the hot hand. i would've loved to see morris get 5 of those minutes in that run. All harris has to do is shoot the shot with more confidence and I am ok with him staying in.", ">Im not saying he isn't useful or hasn't helped at all\n\nThat's EXACTLY what you said: \n\n> Lets trade harris for a better sg or pf please. Harris has done nothing and if he doesn't score we can use that $$ elsewhere.", "Or timofey mozgov drop 93 & 29?", "At least for now???? Melo is literally a HOF\u2019er...", "Right, so you agree he has no business playing ISO basketball because he\u2019s not on the level of just purely beating other teams on talent from a lack of defense.... \n\nHe falls into the Russ/ Harden category of being great individually, but being a huge detriment to their team and enabled by bad coaching and the league that favors franchise players for ratings. \n\nGrant on the other hand is a Melo caliber player that instead of being in an ISO system, is a role player and sacrifices for his team. He\u2019s never going to have Melo level stats, but he\u2019s a part of something bigger than himself. And the sum of the parts are greater than the whole. \n\nPlayers like Melo, Harden, and Russ pretty much are the team, they\u2019re not a part of something bigger because nobody is bigger than them, and they will never give their team that opportunity. \n\nBeing teammates or coaches of ISO players is the worst position to be in.", "1 good game, lets give him MVP lol", "Good point, I agree with you there.", "ya in this series he really hasn't. I completely stand by that.", "Hey, I stanned Mozgov for a bit there. He was one of the nicest players I've ever met, and I completely agree with the Lakers decision to give him that fat contract", "Hey if grant randomly averages like 30 and 12 and locks down kawhi and LeBron, you could argue that. Do I think that will happen? No, but he is young, so let's not count him out.", "Preaching to the choir here, so hyped about our team rn. nugs in 7 baby!!", "Pretty sure I didn\u2019t say he should be mvp this year.\n\nInstead, I said he\u2019s the player on our roster most likely to win mvp in the coming years. \n\nHe\u2019ll be an all star within 3 years, mark my words.", "No I\u2019m going to 100% count him out. And I\u2019m a big fan of Grant as well.  He\u2019s not even that young he\u2019s 26, abt to enter his prime. He\u2019s not going to average 30 & 12, Mike Malone probably won\u2019t consistently give him the opportunity to do that.", "Haha, well I hope so, but the Lakers are just stacked with the most talent the league has ever seen, so it\u2019s definitely an uphill battle that\u2019s not likely. \n\nThe Nuggets might meet the threshold of talent to allow working smart to outweigh working hard.", "!RemindMe 3 years\n\nNothing about this dude's rookie numbers says to me that he will be an All Star by the end of his rookie contract, ESPECIALLY in the west.

I mean how good do you think Boogie is gonna be if we resign him? His ceiling is probably about what he did this year 14 mins a game of letting the MVP rest and trying not to blow the game. He was great in the playoffs no doubt but even with him playing a career night tonight he had *19* points. Hardly worth firing the architect of the team for. Gimme a break.", "I wouldnt really say JaVale is... thriving. JaVale has not been that good in the playoffs for PHX... because he's not good.

But it's not like we can overpay him either, he is going to be a free agent and we don't have his bird rights, the maximum salary we can pay is the tax payer's MLE (so like 6M, maybe an overpay, but not some short of albatros contract). Same goes for Rivers, but we get a little more flexibility because we have his early Bird rights.\n\nAlso Barton is perfectly movable if we don't want much in return, his contract is not very rich and it's an expiring one, those have value in itself.", "Damn hyphen", "Honestly even if we can't pay him that much, I think he prefers Mike Malone. So that is a plus.", "Honestly given his age and injury history he might just command a vet minimum. Recall this year, he was a 10 day guy for most of the year till we got him in desperation. Has he parleyed that into more? Maybe, maybe not. Teams might still be gunshy on him. \n\nI do hope he's back though. He was great in the playoffs. I was very impressed and surprised, especially since the end of the year for him was kind of rough, except that last game against LA.", "There are likely a lot of teams that won't want to take him based on his perceived reputation", "No way he's worth more than that. Judging by how he was dropped mid season and kinda struggled to get picked up by another team I think there's a consensus that he's not worth much. He's emotional and cost us at times with stupid decisions and techs. Not saying I don't want him on the team. I love his toughness and I hope they resign him on a deal like Rivers had this year. Also Hartenstein was decent after Plumlee and has been pretty good at times in LA this season trading him for Javale was a mistake considering we never used Javale. And Bol we'll never really know since we never played him either. Of course given the option of all these guys I've mentioned Plumlee is the best.", "Don't think he is worth more considering all his flaw...but i mean some tanking team might throw it at him tho.\n\nHopefully he accepts, he wasn't getting more this season struggled to find a team", "Bones might be starting by the end of next season (I hope so, anyway).", "Hope you're right. Not saying you're wrong. Just seems a little lacking to me. Warriors have a helluva bench and it blows that group you mentioned out of the water. Steph/Otto Porter/GP/Bjelicia with a couple young guys in the same vain as Bones below that in Kuminga/Moody. And that's not blended that's pure bench 0 starts for any of those guys in the playoffs so far at least. Even if you omit Steph because he's really a starter and don't replace him with any of the starters I didn't mention that bench is better. They have an elite bench so maybe it's an unfair comparison but that's the goal right? I'd still say we're going from bad to decent. Not trying to be pessimistic because certainly there will be moves this offseason on the back end and who knows what it'll wind up looking like. Hopefully Zeke makes strides too he certainly had his moments at least offensively this year. I think we're overvaluing Boogie here a bit. He was great in the playoffs and I want him back for his edge but the idea that he's an elite backup doesn't quite seem right to me. He struggled for a lot of the season and only managed a real contract after what like 4 10 days. I just don't buy that one 19 point performance in the playoffs negates his very real deficiencies on defense and decision making. Again hope I'm wrong and the second unit puts it's very real collective talent to good use but I'm not sold. At least not with a little more than just bones/monte/boogie also of those 6 guys you mentioned who's playing defense?", "That gets me wet", "his contract is incredible also, we have to keep him. he's getting better still, and he's got a lot of playoff experience now. big dick te and jokic have a bromance for the ages too, you can't take that away from them.", "barton only has more value if you find a tanking team. monte can actually play basketball consistently and is a low maintenance player that can play on any team. he has value on the court, so you get more options.", "Yeh I think Monte has more trade value by now", "Whatever it takes as long as we get him, I would hate to think that MPJs max contract would deprive us from getting Boogie back, I\u2019d like to have guys that will own it under the hoop instead of one waiting in the corner to get the ball for his shot", "> But that's a crazy take on Connelly though if you're serious. He's built a team that probably has a pretty bright future barring injuries and bad luck.\n\n\nTo be fair TC had some obvious blunders over the last few seasons.", "Javales been good in his role for the Suns, 10 PPG in 10 mins for your backup center ain\u2019t bad. But Defensively he\u2019s been pretty mid along with his rebounding. \n\nBut they\u2019re playing Biyombo because they opted to play a twin towers lineup of Javale n Ayton to match Nance and JV who have been destroying them on the glass.", "We only get 1 MLE a year so using it on him definitely has some effect on roster building though maybe not that big of deal because who knows who else is available for that. And if they decide to use it to extend him multiple years that swallowable $6 mil could look more like $20 mil. No idea what the plan his here just hope they don't go too far. I'm no expert so please correct me if I'm wrong on any of that fr. And isn't it more like Barton's contract is moveable if we throw in assets? Like Kenny Faried a few years ago had to throw in a 1st to move that guy. Though he made a bit more and they included Arthur I think.", "It\u2019s Michael", "This. I think he\u2019s finally found a team where he fits in with his style, along with liking Malone. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see him back next season for a decent price deal (like cheap and friendly)", "People have forgotten all the bone headed plays and shots he makes and the techs he seems to thrive on. I'm with you hope he's back but at a reasonable amount. That reasonable amount being a one year vet min\n\nEdit: Had to look it up he had 16 techs this season one shy of the conference leader.

Kuminga and Moody could change that but they'll still be developing for another year or more.", "If you're looking to win, sure. \n\n\nIf you're looking to open cap space and create squad flexibility, it's Barton.", "Yeah I agree. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how they handle the mpj contract", "Oh for sure. No GM is 100% and he's had a few doozys. And the team had some really really bad luck but just the fact that he plucked Jokic out of nowhere and they developed him into an MVP is crazy huge. The only MVP in team history. Very much on his way to being the best player in team history. And It's not just him there's two young stars that are coming back next year that he also drafted. One of which was in the late lottery which is generally a crapshoot on talent. So yes to say he should be canned because he let a backup center on the wrong side of 30 with a history of injuries and attitude problems walk is crazy. Even saying it's cumulative and that's the final straw is a stretch since the team is very much still in their championship window with none of their 3 stars being over 27. Isn't he at least owed that since this iteration would absolutely not exist without him? Firing GMs is usually based on losing. Which is not something they've done a lot of. This season was tough because of injuries. Last season was tough because of injuries. Conference finals before that. 4 playoff series wins in 4 years ain't bad and actually ties their best mark in team history over that timeframe one more and they'll have matched playoff series wins for the whole 80s which is by far their most successful decade in the NBA. This team is good, real good, historically good for the franchise. Firing the guy that built them at their apex would probably be a huge mistake.", "Boogie's contract would only count against the MLE (wich is very small when the team is paying the luxury tax) next year, after that we have his early Bird rights, or if we sign him for 2 years now then that and we would have his full Bird right. There is some effect there, but at the end of the day we are not getting anyone better than him for his money, the young players we alredy have we will keep as long as Kroenke is willing to foot the bill anyway, and the other young players we might add are mostly UFAs that get signed for the minimum, so cap space again is not a concern.\n\nAnd the kind of contracts that Barton has are usually the easiest to move. Don't get me wrong, if we only put him in the trade we can get either another player at his level if another team needs his scoring and self creation over whatever their roleplayer does, maybe a slightly better player in a longer contract if a team is clearing up cap space for 2023 (we are more likely to get that kind of trade once the season is alredy started), or a small asset and a worse or longer contract. But the main use of contracts like the one Barton is on are trades that include other players, to match salary. If we want to go after a starting SG, Barton + an asset gets it done most of the time. Those are also great to get into multiple team trades.", "it\u2019s actually Head Coach Michael Malone(tm)", "Mr. Malone if you're nasty fuuu", "Exactly. And if he'll sign for that, that's a good deal.", "You're right he's more a clown then anything", "Yeah you may be right I'm not arguing with you on that one. Certainly more upside\n\nEdit: my point wasn't really that plum was better than hart but that boogie ain't worth a ton and that we've had serviceable backups since plumlee", "I wish that were true", "> Firing the guy that built them at their apex would probably be a huge mistake.\n\nLet's be clear here, I am not advocating for TC to get fired! That would be dumb as hell. I am just stating the facts here, TC had his fair share of blunders over the past few seasons. Also, it was Karnisovas who convinced Jokic's agent to let Jokic come to Denver. TC got extremely lucky with that draft pick. One more thing, most of the blunders that FO had made over the years were due to Malone being a poor judge of talent. Malone keeps young players glued to the bench(while playing washed-up vets instead), the FO lets them walk for free, they end up on some other team with some smarter coach, and they get to ball out. This is the scenario that we have seen over the years happen over and over again. So, there it is, I am not even blaming TC, but Malone, I just think that he is a mediocre coach, our version of Mark Jackson. He lacks in things that are required to win the championship. Hopefully, they get to find their version of Steve Kerr in the future.", "Gotcha. That all makes sense but again I really hope we don't invest multiple years in Boogie. Herb Jones and Jose Alvarado were both MLE last year so it is possible to get young talent ready to play for it but I'm sure it's really rare. Mostly just vets that want more than the minimum. I think you may be overvaluing Bartons contract here but I'm not sure. Any examples of expiring contract trades you can think of? Not saying your wrong just curious what we realistically may get in return. Though based on our history I'd guess we keep Barton the whole season and maybe past that even. They've been in this situation with him before and haven't moved him after all.\n\nEdit: Nevermind found a good article on it. [LInk](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2021/03/nba-trade-candidate-watch-mid-sized-expiring-contracts.html) Of the 13 guys listed in this article as expiring deals that could be good trade candidates(including Barton ironically enough) 5 were traded. McDermott with multiple 2nds for a 2nd, Olynyk with a 1st for Oladipo, Johnson for ostensibly nothing(Redick and Melli), Hood with Trent Jr for Powell, and Leonard and a 2nd for Ariza. Some interesting trades there for sure. Powell being the outlier but it was more of a salary ballast like you explained. So possible we get a good player like Josh Hart but we'd have to give up some considerable assets I'd guess Bones or a couple 1sts if that Powell trade is any indication. I guess I don't see that happening but maybe. We could get a cheaper vet like the Oladipo or Ariza deals which is intriguing for sure. Overall I'd say it's not as cut and dry as Barton + an asset gets a deal done but maybe under the right circumstances. No teams are beating down the door for Bartons services. Also a couple of those trade candidates were just waived so that's possible too I suppose but doubtful with no value coming back. Forgot to say this was last years trade deadline so not exactly the same but a decent comparison.", "100% agree", "Both Herb and Alvarado could have been signed using a 2 year minimum salary contract anyway for the same money, and then extended using the early Bird rights matching any offer from other teams with the Gilbert Arenas provision to reach normal player with Bird rights status after that. The MLE was just used so that NOLA can underpay them for a year or 2, and we don't do that.", "Gotcha. Do you work for the team? You're knowledge is impressive either way! Thanks for the incite", "No way, I'm not even from the USA!  But I read about all the exceptions in detail after being completly lost the first time I was trying to follow an offseason. Also u/BroncoSqatch breaks down those kind of things at the start of every offseason (I think he mentioned the Barton contract in an episode with the LON podcast), and there are always videos on YouTube about anecdotes such as the Arenas restricted free agency...

Keeping Monte might require losing Barton to a salary dump trade.\n\nI do think money is going to be tighter this offseason than people are expecting.

Our owners don't exactly have a history of spending a lot of money, either (cf practice facility, no D-League team).", "Aha! I learned something today.

He'll make him work, and he has the athleticism and length to at least make it a challenge which the Rockets did not. I wouldnt be shocked as well if we see some PlumKic with Plumdog checking AD. I think he actually can also at least make it difficult.\n\nI mean, it's not like we had full time PG and KL stoppers either, both had some good games which is the nature of the sport. But I do believe with Malone/Unseld scheming, and the guys we have, we can make a good effort at it. Especially given the Lakers are VERY bricky shooters. If we can hang on the glass and turn them into a jump shooting team I like our chances.", "Billionaires actually made a lot of money during the pandemic.\n\nStan Kroenke's net worth had increased by half a billion back in April. Probably even more than that now. I don't know the inner workings of Nuggets ownership or if he's \"technically\" still involved, but all Josh's money comes from his parents anyway.\n\nIf ever there is a time to suck it up and pay everyone, it's now. The team is four wins away from the NBA finals. Using money as an excuse to let someone walk and/or dump contracts to save money now, when billionaires have been doing pretty well, would be absurd. The owners may have lost some money on direct NBA revenue this year, but they're likely all coming out ahead regardless.", "Fuck that, we need to pressure the owners to spend money.", "I wouldn't let Craig walk, his defense is extremely valuable in the playoffs. Just resign everyone and let them grow for another year.", "Man you have given me the hope. I do think it comes down to Jeremie Grant now. I think he will make his name in this series as an all-star, future Hall of famer if we want to win the series", "I couldn\u2019t agree more, but it doesn\u2019t change the way these AH billionaire owners look at this stuff. They\u2019re likely to separate out the basketball operations from their other income and want it to be individually profitable. I have not a lot of love for the Kroenkes, especially since they committed the cardinal sin of moving a professional sports team. \n\nAt least the paid Joker and Jamal the money.", "Smart billionaires see dynastic teams as investments in the future. The Warriors built an insane arena based on essentially 5 years of revenue from having a great time.", "Woah now not that far. JG is awesome but he'll never be an all star. I'd be shocked if that was a thing. BUT, he can certainly make an All-Defense team at some point in his career, maybe a few. This series will probably be just as much or more of a challenge than the last one, if a different kind of challenge due to AD being a 4 rather than a wing, with loads of athleticism and strength.", "When did Josh take over control, and/or how much control does he actually have?\n\nI would have zero faith in Stan spending any real money, but Josh is a young guy who genuinely cares about basketball. I've been a fan of his since he was a teenager (we grew up in the same town and went to the same schools, though he was a bit older). He grew up on the AAU circuit with a handful of guys who would go on to be NBA players, and he would've been a solid college player himself if not for multiple major knee injuries.\n\nSo I'm fairly certain he's passionate about the game and understands the importance of keeping guys together.\n\nNow, none of that matters if Stan is still calling the shots behind the scenes or caps how much Josh is able to spend.", "If he is not the one, then we better hope that plumlee and the rest of the cast can perform some sort of defensive magic. I think AD is going to be our biggest trial. Yes Donovan Mitchell was a big time trial, but we had people that we could stick on him. With AD, I don't think we can stick to many other people. We're going to need Grant to have the very best series of his lifetime and prove that he could be an all-star. That's the only way I see the nuggets winning.", "It\u2019s a good question, and I have no idea. I don\u2019t know how autonomous Josh is. TBH I\u2019ve never heard a bad thing about Josh, but people are always blowing smoke up the ... of rich folk. I like to think he\u2019s a good one, though. The organizational strength of the Nuggets does reflect well on him, though.", "Donovan I think was actually a bigger challenge before Gary came back. Without Gary, asking Torrey and mostly Grant to guard Mitchell was a problem. Grant hung ok but Mitchell is so quick and explosive he mostly got around both he and TC3.\n\nAgain just because he can defend AD well doesnt mean he'll ever have a chance at an all-star berth. Jerami will never handle the ball enough or shoot/score enough to be that, that just isn't who he is or ever will be. And that's ok! This series he just has to make AD work. That's it. Just dont get killed, and I dont think he will.\n\nThe path to victory doesnt even require that honestly though. If AD scores 30 or 35 we can still win. We have to keep the rest of the role players from going off. We have to turn the Lakers into jump shooters, again and make them play halfcourt, because they're not a good halfcourt offense, and they are NOT a good shooting team. That means we need to pack the paint, defend the rim, and we need to rebound at the highest level we have this year. As often as possible it needs to be one shot and done possessions for LAL. If we allow them to own the glass and get out in transition, that's when we'll be in trouble.", "Okay once again you have given me some hope here. Any word on Will Barton? We're going to need to flood the scene", "No word yet. Connelly talked with him and he's rehabbing but no word. If anything I'd hope he can get  back late in the series, but I wouldnt count on it.", "Mike Malone has proved to be the difference in both of these series because he has made the decisions very late in the series. I doubted Mike Malone, but I got my full faith that he can plug the proper people in at the proper time. What are your thoughts on Mike Malone doing his thing, and just plug in the right guys and we just flood the scene on AD? Thus we neutralize him? I'm thinking a big plumlee series here.", "I think he'll figure out the right moves to make. Will it be enough to take the series? I dunno, the Lakers are really good. But he's REALLY proven himself to me this playoff run. Realistically we all questioned if he could truly turn this team from a good young team into a contender. Well - he's got us in the WCF. The team believes in him and loves him. And he made the adjustments to get us here (and was ready for LAC and Utah's counters). He's proved it. The only mountain left is getting to the Finals and winning one. That's it. I think he can do it. Again - will it be enough to win? I dunno. It should be another epic series though.", "I really thought his coaching was the difference. Yes he let our team get down and out and he doesn't have the gun punch to fuck the opponent. but at the end it was like he was toying with the other side. The matchups were intense based on Mike Malone. He had some sort of secret sauce. I cannot explain it. After we were down 3:00 to 1:00 to the jazz, I was thinking that the coach should be fired, and I was wrong. And then he just made a bunch of switches. Lineup changes it was crazy I've never seen it.

Having said that, I forgive Tom. I forgive every fan in the New England area, and I apologize for ever thinking they were shitty fans. The shit I\u2019ve seen out of LA makes me realize how blessed I am to have New England sports as my rival, not whatever the fuck they do in LA as my rival. Laker fans have made me turn a new leaf and appreciate every single Tom Brady touchdown drive with under a minute remaining to win in walkoff fashion. At least he didn\u2019t flick me off and tell me to go fuck myself while he did it", "he has a very sweet and respectful vibe while still knowing how to get shit done", "I totally agree here. As I\u2019ve seen with 3 other teams this post season, the real fans only come into our sub when they want to congratulate us, wish us luck, or pay respect for our squad. It\u2019s the bandwagon fans of LA that are so toxic. You can always tell they are bandwagon fans as well because they literally lack basic knowledge of basketball or of any of the players not named Lebron James. \n\nI had a Laker fan seriously tell me that Bam Adebayo only played well offensively against Milwaukee because \u201ceveryone know Brooke Lopez trash at defense.\u201d Yea that\u2019s why he\u2019s on an all defensive team this season, right buddy?", "Honestly I find the \"___ fan here, coming in peace\" no matter what fan you are is pretty annoying. I prefer to just stay within your respective sub, if you want to chat with others go to r/nba\n\nWith that said, my prev comment was kinda more rude than it needed to be, I'm just salty towards lakers in general", "Take the L", "Facts idgaf if we lost to a team that blew a 3-1 lead since that means we make everyteam we play with blow a 3-1 lead lol.\nFuck the Lakers\nLETS GO HEAT\n#WINNING", "I trust you, Heat bro! FTL!", "My teams are the wolves and the Nugs. Jimmy was a locker room cancer in MN. He is good at basketball, but he isn't a bonafide leader like he wants you to believe. The dude can hoop though.", "Bro its funny af if lebitch loses that means he went to 10 finals only won 3 is that the worst championship winrate in the finals? like 33% win rate thats pretty bad man but gotta admit the guy is a beast", "You guys have been some of the loudest supporters in our sub, it\u2019s why I subbed here. Well, that and your squads post season was significantly similar to ours and I was impressed as hell. The joker is already an all time favorite player of mine because of his entirely unique style as a big. I also love that he definitely is outof shape but balls out like he\u2019s 5% body fat. \n\nDamn! I hadn\u2019t heard about that phone call. Do you know any details of it? I doubt Vogel has those kind of coach connections, he just seems less approachable and friendly.", "Ah the old ill take one example and apply it to the masses. There are millions of lakers fans. If all you can say is that a couple made us look bad then I'm okay with that. Better then seeing the majority of nuggets fans on reddit turn into the biggest salty sore losers in the game. \n\nDuring our series there was mad respect but yall couldn't handle losing and beating the clips got to your guys head. Maybe next year.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Almost all of them have being complete fucktards, but there's a select few who've come just to say how much they respect Jimmy. Those are the ones I'm okay with", "Coincidentally, FTL is the acronym used for Ft. Lauderdale which is the neighboring city to Miami, a drive of around 20 minutes. Happens to perfectly also stand for fuck the lakers.", "Seems pretty clear to me that the real locker room cancer was KAT. Butler is certainly a strong personality and I can see why people would think he's too much, but the proof is in the pudding. Dude is in the finals, Minnesota looks like the non-contender they've always been. But you do you my dude", "You just forgot to /s, right?", "He\u2019s literally leading a team of rookies and d-leaguers to Game 6 of the Finals fam. How many years did Kat lead ur team to the promise land? And the one w Jimmy G Buckets dont count \ud83d\ude09", "And you expect me to believe that bitch KAT is a leader?", "Bro... If Bosh doesn\u2019t get a lucky offensive rebound only because Tim Duncan was not on the floor in favor of an extra wing defensive player being out there and he doesn\u2019t see ray for the assist, Lebron bricks the last shot to lose game 6 of the 2013 finals. It\u2019s unbelievable the luck he benefited from to win that.\n\nAlso, without Kyries insane shot he loses the one Cleveland ring. Realistically if the cards fell slightly different he is 1-8 in the finals right now and potentially going 1-9 if Miami wins", "Yeah man im from Miami and thats how i initially found out the nuggets by watching the bubble game of nuggets vs heat and i loved the nuggets and they became my favorite team (hadnt watched any basketball before the bubble) so im obv gonna root for miami since im from here lol but nuggets is my main team. jokic is a beast such a funny guy love him \n\nthe call thing was a joke lol its a joke around here since coach malone is now the comeback king it would be funny if coach spoelstra called him.\n\nfuck the lakers tho their series against  us was trash to watch did not enjoy at all jokic was literally in foul trouble like all 5 games couldnt even watch my favorite player play fuck the lakers please whoop their asses their fans are toxic af", "You want to say I\u2019m imputing a single fan onto the base as a whole, and that\u2019s so wrong, and then you proceed to do the exact same thing for nuggets fans. Not surprised, exactly what I would expect from a mouthbreathing knuckle dragger", "Do you scour every inch of the internet looking for Lakers slander? Or are you often browsing subreddits of teams that the Lakers arent even playing against", "I literally have no dog in this as an eastern conference fan, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s basically an objective fact that Denver has a really decent fan base. I doubt many people around the league would call that a hot take. The Lakers fans in the current year on the other hand... \n\nYou guys realize this Laker team and it\u2019s ridiculous fans are doing serious damage to the storied Laker basketball brand... the vast majority of Laker \u201cfans\u201d I see act like they\u2019ve never been to the finals before. They haven\u2019t. They\u2019ve all jumped a bandwagon, it\u2019s why their subreddit gained over 100k members in a fucking year lmao", "Look whose team has fans brigading other teams constantly whenever they play a playoff series. You can\u2019t say shit lol", "Lmao!!! Imagine not being ironic and calling me a sore loser as a reply to what I wrote! Did you even read it? \n\nFirst of all, you absolutely do not even cross my mind if not for the fact you and your little butt bro\u2019s have NON STOP been shit posting in every single  internet discussion site I use for 2 weeks now. It\u2019s beyond even being annoying at this point. It\u2019s just toxic and I\u2019m beginning to think a lot of you guys are suffering from undiagnosed mental health issues. \n\nSecond, you replied to a comment where I was contrasting how NORMAL people deal with their favorite teams wining and losing championship games and how Laker fans have been dealing with these same two things. Here\u2019s a hint: one of those two sends death threats to the wives of players on their team. The other shows gratitude for their teams efforts, even when they\u2019ve Lost. \n\nYou should immediately go read the definition of sore loser because, even in victory you are demonstrating the symptoms of being a sore loser. It\u2019s wild", "Wait they come to our sub to say that? I've been gone for a month or so", "I wouldn't expect any different from a Heat fan. He's been great for you folks. If you followed him at all before he got to the heat, you'd change your mind.", "Naw. I'm not kidding. The dude is a shitty leader no cap. He turns into a bitch when he isn't winning.", "I never said KAT was a leader.", "KAT isn't a leader though, and I never said he was.", "Bro, I honestly thought LA might be a better matchup for Miami because Denver is much deeper and has many more options than LA for scoring, and still I found that series to be so one sided by refs. One of the last games, maybe game 5? I had to turn off because I was so disgusted by the one sided calls. Also, Lebron and the lakers are so unhappy. They aren\u2019t having any fucking fun and it\u2019s ridiculous. The joker said in EVERY interview I saw him give that all he cared about was having fun and putting in his best effort to win. Why the hell would anyone root for the guy that always seems angry at the world (Lebron) when you\u2019ve got a dude just playing ball and having fun to root for? The joker is an absolute unit.", "Just like you are proving my point that all nuggets fans are sore losers who keep crying about it? Great we proved each others points! \n\nExactly what I would expect from a team that just has never been able to do it. Gotta blame someone else. I get it.", "I\u2019ve been calling them cockroaches for this reason, they\u2019re literally everywhere and out of absolutely nowhere", "A few do, or I've seen them give respect to Jimmy and not acting like a bitchy 12 year old when I check their sub for good Danny Green jokes", "Please just stop this. It\u2019s so silly. In less than a calendar year, Jimmy took our franchise, which has been stuck at .500 for a half decade to the fucking finals. \n\nNot a single person outside of Miami in the media or sports world gave Miami any time of day. Jimmy convinced his teammates and then us fans that he absolutely wasn\u2019t joking about making the finals this year. We eventually believed the guy... So, we tell everyone outside of Miami how good we are because we trust our leader, Jimmy. What does everyone outside Miami say? \u201cY\u2019all delusional as fuck trash ass team.\u201d \n\nAt this point we\u2019ve been telling y\u2019all for nearly a year and until last night people were still laughing. God fucking damnit. If accomplishing that alone isn\u2019t enough for you, he\u2019s taken our fucking rookies under his wing and given them the confidence to contribute in a finals series! Miami is only in this position because Jimmy is the greatest leader in our organizations history. I\u2019ve been a fan for almost 20 full years, I adore Dwade, but Jimmy is our all time greatest leader and it\u2019s not close. Just fucking leave his name out of your vocabulary. Your unworthy, that\u2019s why he fucking hated your team\n\nIn one season the man made himself into a Miami folk hero. He\u2019s got fucking murals of himself all over Miami that people have painted of him. He\u2019s an icon", "That's cause the other teams he was on didn't have a culture of winning. No one else cared as much as him. EVERYONE on the Heat cares as much as him. He wasn't a locker room cancer. No one else was willing to do what it took to when", "I never said u did, but he\u2019s suppose to be and he aint. \n\nSn: Kat is a good dude. My heart goes out to him and everything he\u2019s had to go through this year with his mom\u2019s passing.", "They've gotta be the most sensitive fanbase in all of sports", "Yikes. The amount of Jimmy dick riders is astounding. Fuck Jimmy Butler. He's straight trash.", "Not true at all. The wolves want to win as much as anyone. We haven't had the right pieces for a long time unfortunately. And yes, Jimmy was a huge locker room cancer for us. The dude constantly bitched and complained when he didn't get his way. He's a pussy.", "They make the poor 76ers fans look like emotionally hardened ex cons.. If not the most sensitive, they\u2019re absolutely the most annoying. \n\nWe somehow managed to play 3 other teams in the bubble playoff, 2 of them bitter rivals, yet their fans were nothing but pure class to us in our sub. My encounters with Celtics fans on this platform were surprisingly warm and our organizations have history. We have no history with LA and it\u2019s been an absolute shit show and it\u2019s been non stop. These fucking losers claimed themselves champs before the ECF was concluded if you recall. They said it literally didn\u2019t matter they\u2019d sweep either team. I enjoy talking to 28 other subs on reddit. One just stands out as a bit different than the others...", "Oh, you\u2019re 7 years old. I get it now. I think there\u2019s an age requirement for this platform little guy", "Tonight was another great example of Jimmy's inadequate leadership. Everyone played like shit.", "Uh huh.

First, the roaster construction... Jamal is not a fucking point guard, never was, and might never be! Monte is a true point guard!:0 How difficult is this to grasp? Also, Jamal is just not good enough yet... he is still too young for what is expected of him out there. The problem is that we are getting even younger!?:0 We have to decide at some point, are we a rebuilding team, or what are we exactly at the moment? Second, are we an offensive or defensive minded team? Moach wants us to be a defensive minded, but we keep drafting all these young offensive minded players that cant play any defense:) Also, Yok has tendencies to \"tune out\" if things dont go his way!? I mean, how can you blame him. We are a mess at the moment. Yok has probably had enough of Malone and his defense by all means necessary?(this is a wild guess of course) So much is asked of coach as well.

He brings up LeBrons advanced stats every segment to argue for him over Jordan, and even there he\u2019s selective about it because Jordan\u2019s are arguably more impressive on a per-minute basis over their careers (higher BPM, WS/48 and PER in both the RS and playoffs) and inarguably more impressive over their best 5-7 year periods, in every stat: much higher WS, much higher WS/48, higher BPM, much higher VORP, PER, Wins Produced/48. Also, higher WS/48, BPM, PER and WP/48 in the playoffs. Yet still, Wright trumpets cumulative advanced stats (total win shares, career VORP, etc) and makes it seem like that\u2019s the end of the story.\n\nHere he just ignores the stats altogether. I mean that in a literal sense and not as a form of hyperbole, because you couldn\u2019t have two MVP candidates that are further apart in stats (every conceivable one except APG and TPG, and Jokic is a centre, with a higher usage rate and he throws more high-leverage passes per 100 possessions so he\u2019ll have more turnovers.) Jokic is having all-time years in terms of PER, TS% for a high-usage big man, BPM, OBPM, and WS/48. Talkin\u2019 6th-12th ALL-TIME in a single season for every category except TS%. If those statistics aren\u2019t revelatory in any way then throw them all out. All of them. Because if a historically great season gets treated as blas\u00e9 then there\u2019s just no point even referencing advanced stats if they can\u2019t capture the approximate value of even the BEST seasons on record.", "That's not even remotely true", "brandon marshall was just as bad as nick wright in that debate, it was hard to watch. really shows why christ broussard has an mvp vote and they don\u2019t", "Hot takes get attention, even bad ones.

No. That's not what the award is for.\n\nAnd it's within everyone's right to hate the Shit Bayless type of \"analysis\" we get today.\n\nBut, to disagree with Nick with valid reasoning on this subject, you'd have to list which winners in the last 35 years you think aren't as good as Jokic. Before I even pull up the list, I know MJ, LeBron, Shaq, Curry, Bird, Magic, Hakeem and Malone are on there. Which one, exactly, are you bypassing for Jokic?\n\nPulled up the list now. You trading Kobe, Duncan or KD for Jokic?\n\nWestbrook put up more points, more assists and damn near the exact same # of boards as Jokic is this year.\n\nHarden is the most underappreciated superstar maybe ever. \n\nAI, Barkley and KG are HOFers. \n\nDavid Robinson and Nash had higher winning %s when they won MVP.\n\nEven Giannis has a strong case that his MVP seasons were more impactful (again, most *valuable* player in the regular season. Doesn't mean best player in the league. But, the best player on the best regular season team is a strong argument for regular season MVP.)\n\nSo, I mean, both things can - and are, in this circumstance - be correct.

And when you take AD into account as a PF/C hybrid then you can\u2019t really say Vuc is better than Jokic, Embiid, and AD. I think there is a lack of good centers in the league that are as effective as Jokic and Embiid so they dominate the conversation, but I don\u2019t think Vuc is in the same league. If I was willing to give him number 3 it\u2019s because the distance between 2 and 3 is so vast. Vuc is not a HOF talent and Embiid and Jokic are 100% future HOFers. \n\nI don\u2019t think the Small market is a factor. I live in Florida. I\u2019m not a Magic fan but I know Magic fans and none of them were happy with him either. It\u2019s not hard to be the best player on a shit team and when he went to the Bulls they absolutely got worse. Fantasy is different and football isn\u2019t the best comparison, but I guess that\u2019s my only frame of reference since I don\u2019t play fantasy basketball.", "Word bro.  At the same time never said that Vuc was better than Jokic.  Just said fantasy rating had him higher than Embiid for a variety of reasons.  Also saying that AD is a center is just so that Jokic doesn't end up for first team NBA in back to back seasons, I hope you can understand that as AD never plays center.\n\nAs for Vuc going to the Bulls, realistically he went from a shit team to a slightly less shit team, who was dealt a Zach LaVine-less team for most of his tenure there.  Why did Chicago trade for him? Obviously to make their team better, did it turn out this season?  Probably not.  Can he make huge impacts for the '21-'22 season and '22-'23 season.  I'm willing to bet money he can, even at his advanced age. Remember Bulls got VP Arturas Karnisovas and the guy knows quite a bit about evaluating talent.", "That\u2019s fair. I guess I don\u2019t pay enough attention to how AD plays to see he doesn\u2019t play C. I just know he\u2019s a hybrid type player. I will say that I do hope Vuc does better. I just don\u2019t feel he\u2019s as high a talent as you say he is, which is fine.", "For sure, agree to disagree.  I was talking about this season only and the stats would be in Vuc's favor imo.  At the same time like I said.. If I was arguing Vuc as a top 3 center I would be pulling a Nick Wrong.  Saying top 5 C is  untenable when looking at this season alone though."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

Touches really aren't relevant here. Jokic led the league in touches but no one thinks he's a ball hog, because the type of touches are the important part.

He's a great player why waste him on a second rounder that probably won't be as good", "Yeah - I guess Bones figured he didn't need any further seasoning running the second unit, learning how to not be a D liability and embracing a culture of sharing the ball and getting teammates involved. \n\nObviously last night was a game when we desperately missed Bones - the second unit couldn't buy a bucket. Having B.Brown run with the first unit puts a ton of pressure on Ish. During the playoffs, Murray isn't gonna have to deal with this asinine NBA regular season schedule and if Dunkle Jeff stays healthy, Cancar continues to evolve, T. Bryant slots into his role, Braun continues to improve, Ish is Ish - I'm perfectly happy letting Bones go the Clippers and take his chances with the black hole offense of Paul George and Kawai.", "MPJ had the same im great attitude, and got sat for it.

At this stage, it looks like Bones' projected floor is good bench PG, and his ceiling is Lillard with better D.\n\nYes, his D sucks now, but he has the tools to improve there.  Yes, he chucked, but the 2nd unit's toilet bowl offense is going to create those kinds of looks.  He's a young PG, and those usually take time to develop.\n\nHe's going to be given time in the league to develop, and I fully expect him to become at least a 6th man of the year candidate if not a lot more.  It sucks that the Nuggets didn't just stash him on the bench this year and live with whatever antics he put out there until a better offer came along.", "He's on his 2nd year.

How is Poole a bad comp?", "Great is definitely a stretch... he had some fantastic nights and brought some great energy off the bench in a few games, but that ultimately doesn't make up for his inconsistency on offense when it comes to scoring or making plays for his team on his off nights. Especially for a player that is a liability on defense. The bare minimum that you ask for a reserve PG like Bones is to not turn the ball over on offense and to play decent defense when on the floor, which he isn't yet capable of doing. I can't emphasise this enough: GMs aren't looking for players that are streaky on offense and consistently terrible on defense. At this point in his development he really isn't worth a whole lot, especially since he's made it public that he has issues with being coached with tough love.", "After not playing him the past few games and all the trade rumors going around I think it would be hard to put back into the rotation.

Even more worthless lmfao.", "Tough to compare players that play on different teams and fill a different niche. JP stepped up to fill the PG position when Curry has been injured and can score from both inside and is a lethal 3P shooter, and fits the Warriors system quite well. You are right in saying his defense is average at best though. The difference is that the Nuggets have scoring options in all of their starters that aren't Jamal, so they don't necessarily need a player that can score like JP can but rather need a PG that can facilitate and play good defense (which the Nuggets have had a continual struggle with this season).", "Issues being lied to, manipulated, and disrespected.", "Yep in a league where everyone can shoot 3s nowadays..", "Bro bones was drafted by us and he isn't Kevin Durant lol we couldve sent his ass to the gleague if we wanted", "Ok so well after his name was floated around.

But you trust a front office that signed DeAndre Jordan to back up Nikola Jokic three seconds into free agency?

It's just flailing your arm into a defender in a motion that doesn't even resemble a shot often, but somehow you get to shoot FTs out of it. Hell it should be called for offensive foul every damn time, especially when the best you could do to justify it being a 'natural motion' would be that you dipped a ball before the shot, but who the fuck dips the ball with their arms fully extended forward, lol? Not a very good basketball player, I'll tell you that much... but somehow very good basketball players get rewarded for pulling off that bullshit.\n\nI mean imagine someone like Torrey Craig who averages like 5 points get away with throwing himself into a defender twice every game... Shouldn't be too hard to find two opportunities for it, and out of them he'd be able to almost double his scoring output, but we all know he'll never get that whistle going his way... If anything, he's getting called for an offensive foul right there.\n\nOr imagine Mason Plumlee a guy who made a total of 2 threes in his entire career scream \"aaay!\" while twitching as if he just got tasered and throwing a ball in the general direction of the rim, before he falls on his ass and slides back a couple feet holding his arms in the air... you really think he's gonna shoot three free throws out of it? Hell no.\n\nRefs somehow look at the guy who averages like 25 points, and shoots close to 40% from the three, and they think his circus shot that just ended up flying like 3 feet right of the backboard, would've somehow gone in if his defender would've just breathed a bit more slowly... or at least had a better chance of going in than that same 'shot' being attempted by somehow who ain't on the refs' approved list.

The timing of the fouls and the freethrows is key when you think about momentum swings.\n\nGame 1 Murray and Jokic are both in foul trouble early because of ticky tacky, stupid calls. This allows the Lakers to basically play our bench for a pretty long period of time. As the game played on, the free throws and fouls might have somewhat evened out, but it just didn't matter. \n\nI would say game 2 was the best reffed game. Nothing egregious I'd say, the nuggets just lost a tough game.\n\nGame 3 when the nuggets were up by 18 or 20 or whatever it was, the lack of fouls being called on the lakers allowed them to get back into the game. Rondo was basically on top of Murray's nuts during the couple of turnovers that led to easy transition points. The lakers were allowed to do whatever they want up until the game got close again. \n\nContext is key with those two stats you brought up and if you can't realize that, there's no reason to keep going back and forth. Murray had THREE circus shots that should have been and 1's that he didn't get because his name is Lebron or AD. And the fact of the matter is that if the nuggets were to play the way the lakers are allowed to, all of our starters would foul out in the first half, if not the first quarter. Like when Lebron tackled Garris to get his rebound. If I had the time or energy, I could come up with another probably 25 similar events that screwed the nuggets. \n\nIt would be one thing if this was the first instance of a Lebron team being allowed to do whatever they want or if it was just nugget's fans complaining, but it's not. Fans from almost every team agrees that the nuggets are getting absolutely boned. Even one of my friend's who is a Lakers fan called me last night to say sorry about it cause it's just obvious. Portland and Houston fans complained about some of the same things and take a look at the Cavs v. Warriors finals when they came back from 3-1.

All I ask is for the game to be called evenly and at this point, a large majority would say that it hasn't been close to fair for the nuggets. It's kinda sad.

I would say all the other \"big cities\" are mid market. Denver and Philly included. \n\nThe general \"fun\" factor of the city means the most. These guys make money, a lot, and they wanna live like it. I've been to Boston and Philly extensively, and while they are huge cities, free agents will never clamour to get there, because they are boring.

And I\u2019d be lying if I said I hadn\u2019t thought about simmons before.\n\nBut we have to be able to surround Jokic with shooters or teams will clog the paint. Look at the past postseason. We had so much trouble getting any action going because the only reliable shooter was MPJ and he was having trouble getting open looks. Jokic was struggling trying to do everything himself with so much attention on him.\n\nDo you not remember the Spurs series a few years ago when they decided the plan was to hard double Jokic and force other guys to make shots and it almost worked because dudes were bricking their life away?\n\nJokic needs shooters. I don\u2019t know that AG and simmons can both exist at the same time with Jokic. Not without at least one of them seriously improving their ability to shoot from the outside at the very least, if not also adding a handle and a pull-up game.\n\nSpeaking of, that would leave Murray as the only other true ball handler in the half court since MPJs handle is currently non existent. Simmons is a fine distributor in transition, but he struggles a lot in the half court.\n\nBarton actually fits that lineup better than simmons does. You could maybe make the argument that simmons would be a better 4 next to Jokic than AG, but I think even with AGs 3 point shot being pretty busted, it\u2019s still miles better than simmons non-existent shot. AG can at least get hot and streaky from downtown. Simmons there\u2019s zero respect for him shooting out there from a defensive standpoint.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like you can have simmons and Gordon on the payroll to play one the bench unit minutes. Both do and will command far too much salary.\n\nBen is a unique talent that currently needs a fair amount of tinkering around him to make him work. He wouldn\u2019t be the first.

Everyone has bad fans. But to try to say Utah has classy fans when they have arguably the worst fans when it comes to treatment of opposing teams is laughable", "2019 playoffs and Nurk being a punk ass\n\nEdit: liking the Jazz also comes with childhood. I grew up in Jazz country during the Stockton/Malone era", "Maybe because of the 2019 WCSF?", "Yup. I have absolutely no problem with the jazz, their fans, or their franchise, personally.\n\nNow if you only look at documented cases of fan interaction, you'd be hard pressed to call jazz fans \"classy\" when they have probably the most reported cases of racism/bigotry/straight up taking it too far..\n\nOf course every team has these fans.. on Twitter. In fact I'm guessing the amount of horrible fans directly correlates with how many fans you have.. because some people are just horrible, and where you live or who you root for isn't really going to change the fact that 1/5 people are probably shitty. The thing about a 25 year old man getting shit talked on Twitter, might wanna tie yourself down for this bomb: he DOESNT have to open the app. Thats right, he can actually ignore all internet racism, criticism, and downplaying, if he just.. doesn't open the app designed for teenagers to gossip and talk shit.\n\nThat being said Jazz fans have a lot of controversy surrounding them in REAL LIFE. Not on Twitter. Suppose players can wear earplugs during the game? Its just not the same on the internet as it is when you're ON the court performing for the guy mocking your sick kid.. so let's not pretend it is.\n\nAgain, probably just bad luck, don't think jazz fans are bad people. But how the fuck can you describe what is likely the most negatively reported fan base as \"classy\"..? I mean sure, if you're just living in your own reality. If you knew enough about every NBA fan base you might be insane to call Jazz the classiest.

If you can only guard PFs you are a PF regardless of if you're a PG on offense.\n2. MPJ and PJ Dozier are constantly talking about being able to play 3 positions. [**2-3-4**](https://streamable.com/itbe8i) in MPJs case, and [**1-2-3**](https://streamable.com/ljlzd6) for PJ (*the Will Barton template*).\n3. Paul Milsap & JaMychal Green [**don't give a shit about starting**](https://streamable.com/sr1849) they just want to contribute to a winning team.\n4. Apparently, [**Tim Connelly has new players connect with Monte**](https://streamable.com/63bbyf) as part of the onboarding and welcome. So this really isn't that unusual it would seem.\n\n**For point 1**: They are going to experiment with lineups based on defensive roles. If Facu and Monte can defend together, they are going to play a lot of minutes together. Most likely alongside Thrill, PJ, or Gary to help round out defending the 1-2-3. Outside of shared time on the court, Facu and Monte are 1s and Jamal would need to guard the 2 if sharing the court with the 3 being some one of Thrill,  MPJ, Gary, or PJ.\n\n**For point 2:** Goal isn't to have MPJ start over Barton at the 3, but to start over Paul / Green at the 4. MPJ has been talking about his [**weight room gains**](https://streamable.com/im77w0), watching how Grant was able to [**generate a lot of easy 3s**](https://streamable.com/g48hmd) and dunks as the screener in PnR situations last year, and becoming a [**dominant defender**](https://streamable.com/2s8cm7). This is the role of a 4.  PJ is going to get A LOT of minutes this year, and is [**basically learning Thrill's role**](https://streamable.com/0vw1lg).\n\n**For point 3:** We might have a small-ball bench with both Green and Milsap as our 2nd unit 4 and 5. Both players are getting older and its more important they are healthy come playoff time than coming off a career statistical year. As long as they get diverse experience with different lineups I expect them to each have a more reduced role, particularly Paul in the regular season to both preserve them going forward and free up minutes for Bol, Hartenstein, Nnaji, etc. Granted, they each might look great and be very difficult to take off the court. A good problem to have.\n\n**For point 4:** Monte is the man, and will probably make it work both on & off the court with Facu. Mighty Mouse 2nd Unit backcourt sounds great to me.\n\nIf I had to guess, the Nuggets RS rotation at full strength will look something like.\n\n* Jokic & Murray: *34min - 36min*\n* Thrill & MPJ: *29min - 31min*\n* Gary: *18min - 22min*\n* Monte, Facu, PJ: *16min - 20min*\n* Paul & Green: *8min - 12min*\n* Bol, Hartenstein, Zeke, RJ, Vlatko, Whittington, and Howard would share: *0min - 32min*\n\nNot to mention this rotation would work well because outside of Jokic, the Nuggets have players they could elevate if a player is missing a game for whatever reason and fluidly plug in with the Starters / 2nd Unit while still developing in their defined role(s).\n\nIf Monte and Facu can share the court, the Nuggets might just have the best bench in the NBA and should be able to extend leads against other teams 2nd units.\n\nIf Thrill somehow decides he wants to be Manu or Thunders Harden and come off the bench despite being 3rd on the team in minutes played, the Nuggets have the best bench since the pre-KD Warriors and will probably win a Championship at full health.\n\n**Sauces:** [https://www.youtube.com/c/DenverNuggets/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/DenverNuggets/videos)", "We do not deserve this man.\n\nGIVE HIM KEYS TO THE CITY OR SOMETHING.", "Lol I initially read this tweet as a call to Facu would eat into Monte's phone minutes... \"Oh damn yeah I guess it could be an international call, Monte out here sacrificing an increase in his phone bill\"\n\nWhat is this, 2007?

Particularly when one is a famously gifted passer and the other famously controls pace and doesn't turn the ball over.\n\nIf they can defend, part of me really wants to see Facu and Monte run DHOs like Murray and Jokic and see what chaos they can cause against opposing 2nd unit defenses. Our more limited 2nd unit scorers would benefit from these looks tremendously and if you insert Milsap, Barton, or PJ you get a great triangle of passing and at least 3 players you can trust to facilitate your offense.", "You know what you did.", "made me spit out my drink", "Exactly. Everyone could use a friend like Monte.", "Totally! I\u2019m psyched about Killian and what he can learn from d rose. I\u2019d love to see Monte in Detroit for more emotional reasons than logical ones :)", "Wow, mom and dad, I made it!", "Good points.  My fear was that Monte was not going to be re-signed, but now that he is, I can see this for what it is:  a low-risk, potentially high reward move by the Nuggz.  Hope it pans out.", "Yeah, I guess so.  I\u2019m optimistic about Campazzo too, but I need to see him in NBA action before labeling him a playmaker.  We know he has the passing chops, but I don\u2019t know if he is an NBA-caliber finisher in the paint, has a nice floater/mid-range game, or a reliable 3-ball.  If those are lacking, it hurts his ability to draw in defenders and find open players.  Also I don\u2019t know what the league was like that he played in, but there are a lot of transition plays in his highlights and such opportunities won\u2019t be as prevalent in today\u2019s half-court focused NBA", "It's likely some injury or issue pops up at some point too. A small market team picking up good reasonably priced contracts on good players is about as much as you can ask for. We got more depth now which means less worried of the team tiring out or falling apart in the playoffs from too much strain.", "I think our bench offense should be really dangerous this year. We improved at basically every position offensively.", "Shared it with twitter too. Good stuff friend.", "I've been pouring over Facu stats and obviously highlights cuz it's fun. He is probably considered sub par from three, but if you look at his playoff stats he shoots 48% from beyond the arc. Including 15-16 when he shot .478 from 3 in over 7 attempts. He plays great under pressure and is apparently a tough defender who is scrappy and in everyone's face. I think the extra point guard was a good move in case of Covid emergencies and injuries. He also should just be a fun guy to watch. I'd call him a great playmaker, a menace on defense, and an average shooter who really ups his game in the postseason when it counts. I'm hopeful but still cautious as you must be with a guy who's 5'11 at best"], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

No one on the nuggets is anywhere close to as good as down year AD right now.", "That take is a little disingenuous as LeBron is 100% not immune to that, it's arguably why he has been snubbed in the past. Plus when he formed \"Superteams\" it was always by joining a worse team and being the factor that made the team better. KD joined a 73 win team after Curry had been the first unanimous MVP and had won a chip without him so it was a hard sell to say KD was the MVP after that because context said that Curry didn't need KD to win, making KD very clearly not the MVP. On the flip side KD had won MVP before which also subtracted from Curry chances of getting another MVP. Meanwhile AD hasn't been MVP or on a successful team without LeBron, same with how Bosh hadn't, Love hadn't, Kyrie hadn't etc. Wade had but then age and injuries hit him and he was no where near the player he was when he won Finals MVP in 06. I would say Jokic would have a better case if Nuggets were in the top 2 or 3 in the league, but at the moment they're fringe top 5 which generally isn't good enough for MVP with rare exceptions like Russ averaging a Triple double for the first time since the 60s.

Guy is leading the league in assists and second place isn't even close plus he arguably a top 3 scorer all time and he isn't in your top 5 players right now? Plus he's still dropping 24 a game along side two other great scorers or else he would probably still be dropping 35 a game.", "Kawhi 2 times finals mvp is also extremely underrated. Much better than AD", "To me a top 10 player needs to be the guy who essentially carries the team and creates its identity, creating both for himself and others. Shoulders the load, as it were. It's a little vague and hard to express but to me that means Lillard > AD because he's literally all that separates Portland from being awful right now. Instead they're average! Luka is easily better than AD because of the weight of the offense on his shoulders. Harden is better overall but it's close because his defense aint so good. I'd put Kawhi over AD because he can create his own offense usually. So right now that gives me Jokic, Giannis, KD, LeBron, Harden, Luka, Lillard, Kawhi, and I'd add Steph as well. Steph is for sure a better player than AD, and it's not really close to me. 10th place is harder for me. Jimmy Butler could be in 10th based on how he carried Miami to the Finals last year (with aid from Bam and Dragic). This year **right now** Paul George has been better than AD, no question about it. (In fact you could put Steph firmly ahead of Kawhi, while Kawhi/PG are more in the AD tier)\n\nSo at best AD is 10th for me. At best. My issue with him is he's fundamentally a second option - best second option since Pippen! But historically and with the Lakers he's been at his best and his teams have been best when he isnt asked to be the first option carrying the load night to night. He doesnt really make his teammates better either which is pretty well bared out in the on off ratings for the Lakers the last two years. With LeBron on and AD off, the Lakers still rate as one of the very best teams in the NBA. With AD on but LeBron off, their net rating is around 0. That is, barely average. (You might say but the team is average! But there is my point exactly. For AD to be considered a top 10 player he should lift even an average supporting cast to be better than... somewhere around even in net rating?)", "Smh Clarkson is the only mvp on that team", "They're all zombies for the traditional stars. They need something to snap them to attention for Jokic and I think a big game and W against the Lakers will do it", "ok bruh, just hope you put this much work into your personal relationships too. stay blessed", "Harden got incredible stats by having a team run its offense completely through his hands. He is a great iso player, maybe the best ever, but he just can't work with stars.

Hes 30th in total points scored (Joki\u0107 is 7th, 120 points ahead of him). Hes 15th in PPG. Hes behind Luka, Joki\u0107, Durant, Giannis, Beal, LaVine, Embiid, etc etc. Yeah, hes also not in the top 20 for any FG%, TS%, or eFG%. That was his thing for the past 3 seasons. You'd think since there is less pressure he would be converting at a simular or higher rate, but he's not. Also him playing with other top tier players should hamper his chances. Who does Joki\u0107 have thats even close to KD or Kyrie? Joki\u0107 is the only MVP candidate that doesn't have another All-Star on the roster. The closest Joki\u0107 has is Paul Millsap, who was an All-Star last in 2017. (Before you come at me with \"dAmE TiMe\" he has a 2% chance at MVP according to BB-Ref).", "Kawhi came into a championship level team, had a few nice games in the finals to pull one of the weaker MVPs in recent memory, and as soon as that core aged out of contention, he forced a trade to another title team and led them to another ring. He then joined another team, forced them to trade their future for an all star teammate, and disappeared in the WCF. His MVPs are properly rated for sure.", "I mean, you can make it about teammates, and being the face of a team or whatever, and that's one way to do it. But he has been a consistent 26 and 10 guy on over 60% true shooting for full seasons, as well as one of the elite defensive players in the game. He is a better defender than Kawhi right now, and while he is having a down year so far offensively, he is still 12th in PER and has a long enough track record to say that it is a fluke. People like Luka do not have that yet. AD is the second best two-sided player in the NBA right now, and the gap between him and Giannis is not very big.", "Lol that was absolutely pathetic. Took me about 2 minutes to put that together and an hour later that's the best you got?

Not sure why anyone cares about total assists when players have played different amounts of games.", "Sure, perhaps it's not very big and we're kind of splitting hairs here.

I remember thinking that it seemed weird to me for him to come to a private gym before a game, but I don\u2019t really know what athletes do before the games. I marveled at how much time he spent just stretching to get ready for the game. I watched the game that night and Kobe didn\u2019t even play.

The Suns are just vastly better than the Blazers. It happens. They were able to keep AG out of the paint after game 1. They stopped guarding Austin Rivers because he's streaky and couldnt make them pay (and really - recall against Portland he only had the 1 good game. He hit a couple shots in every other game but that was it). CP3 and Booker > Dame and CJ as well, mostly because CP3 is a better orchestrator by a ton, and Booker is just better than CJ. And bigger. So Rivers could fight on defense just as he did against Dame but it didnt matter, just as it didnt matter against Portland (the difference is PHX actually runs offense whereas the Blazers are very happy to isolate and they BARELY do anything other than simple PnR, no back line movement, no other things (and CP3 / Book are very happy to take the midrange shot, which Dame is not - he just wanted to jack 3s). \n\nFacu was the same in both series. Monte was horrible in game 1 and 2 of this one. He lost his shot in those games. It happens. It wasnt for lack of effort. He played better in the next two games but you saw what happened - did it matter? No. Thrill being truly healthy the whole series *might* have made a difference, but not enough to change the outcome. \n\nThe simple fact is - the only thing in this series to be salty about is Jokic getting tossed in game 4 on a bullshit call. That's it. Without Jamal and PJ Dozier, the Suns were just that much better. The Nuggets didnt \"let them back in\" to game 1 - the Suns took it. At one point they were 12/13 shooting in the stretch from 3.5 minutes left in the 3rd to 8-9 minutes left in the 4th or so. I watched the game twice. A number of those shots, Nuggets defenders were *there*, contesting. There's nothing you can do but tip your cap when a team gets that hot. Thereafter the Nuggets just couldnt get back into it. They fought until it was clearly out of reach. Every game they did, really. The Nuggets, starting *Austin Rivers and Facu Campazzo* just literally had no chance against that team. There's a reason Rivers was not on a team when we picked him up. He's a streaky at best shooter, not a very good ballhandler, and just above average defender. He's fine guarding average to above average players. You cant ask him to guard stars and expect him to limit them the way Gary Harris or PJ Dozier or Thybulle or Mikal Bridges or Jrue Holiday do (or whomever, pick your favorite guard defender). The Suns. Were. Just. Better."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

They only promote certain players/teams, and make the playing field uneven. losing out on millions of fans a s result of it. I've been watching this go on since Byron beck, David Thompson at old Big Mac. At first it was the ABA bias, then it evolved in to the small market bias. The NBA used to be full of teams in smaller cities, and even played regular season games in towns to spread the marketing. Now it's all LA, Lebron and Harden.", "I understand exactly what's happening. My point is he wasn't even close to being the odds on favorite until the last 10-14 days when the injuries piled up. Despite being the clear favorite for MVP, based on performance, The oddsmakers didn't think he would win. Now they do, but only because of injuries. Not because of performance. My point is, yes the oddsmakers base odds, on who they think will win at any given moment, but the award isn't awarded based on performance. If harden returns or Paul continues, I expect Jokers odds to go do won, despite being the obvious choice for the award. The award is just a vote from the biased media. \n We had a similar discussion the other day about the impact of the media on who will actually win the award. Joker is at a huge disadvantage because he's out here in Denver, which might s well be Pluto to most of the journalists. His odds to win haven';t changed based on performance, but because the ads makers see the completion dropping out of the race. .edit words and auto-correct..lol", "I mean, yeah his odds went up after the two other players in the race got hurt. But....literally nobody is debating that this is based on performance? Whether it\u2019s based on injury or performance has no relevance to what the conversation was about to begin with, I\u2019m really confused here man. I agree that the media is biased but the odds are still representative of reality...what is the point in your argument here, and who are you arguing against?", "Go Nuggets!!!", "https://youtu.be/bwV81ESll4c", "Beautiful"], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

Basketball is a \"mood fight\", and Denver are the rebellious underdogs. I think they will win (just).\n\nOf course it's not going to be easy, but Jokic and Murray are the best one-two punch and they broke records to get to the Final.\n\nJokic averaged 24.4 points in the 2nd round, and 13.4 rebounds and 6.6 assists per game. He really displayed his talent. Also Jokic was was contesting shots perfectly, and he had 1.4 blocks. He was safe on defence.\n\nMurray also was very strong and led the team well. He got an injury but kept going. This encouraged the rest of his team. Not only this, but also Murray played well in the PnR with Jokic, Millsap, Grant and the others.\n\nThe Clippers in the regular season averaged 116.3 points per game  (4th in the League), but against Denver in the second round, they could only manage 103.1.\n\nOf course, Denver's first and second round series went to seven games and were bitter fights. So Denver might suffer from fatigue. However, because of Covid-19, the league had a long break so they should be well rested, mentally and physically. It's not an impossible dream for them to win.\n\nIn Denver's franchise history they have reached the conference finals three times. Twice they faced the Lakers and lost. This will motivate them very strongly to change it this time around. \n\nConsidering Denver's first round upset, and in the second round, I predicted both of these. Of course it's different circumstances, and the Lakers are a more powerful team than Denver. However, they been on a roll and will be well motivated to win. I'm tentatively predicting they will show something dramatic again.\"", "The anti-Chuck!

It's more the fact that MPJ is usually standing on the arc with a defender nose-to-nose and not cutting at all, lol\n\nHonestly I'm worried because idk if MPJ is.. slow.. or what. If he's being relegated to arc sitter who runs in for rebounds, or idk. But on offense he has no fucking clue what he's doing and he doesn't even move. Never has he dribbled passed someone. He gets the ball and dunks or he gets the ball and shoots. The guy cannot move around the court at all, it's weird, like he has worse handles than Jokic I swear, although I suppose Jokic mostly moves while posted", "Mike plays too often like he's still the top dog in high school.", "Nah its not that dramatic , just my opinion but if anything he tries to move too much sometimes and cut in spaces where its allready crowded , once he understand the concept of spacing fully and gets a little bit more calm things will look very different , cant even fault him for not understanding spacing when everybody of his teammates just went out of his way his whole HS career . I have seen a lot progress in the playmaking department , he has an eye for his team mates when defenders collaps on him , i think thats jokics influence and i expect that to get a lot better . What makes me modt excited about him is that it seems he got humbled by the last series and he took the benching like a pro , seems to me he wants to be coached and thats the most important part", "I was replying to another comment that said Jokic ices out MPJ and defending Joker not \u201cicing\u201d anyone out. He\u2019s thinking about making the right play, always and that just means not passing it to an inconsistent wildcard like MPJ right now. \n\nMPJ\u2019s minutes have definitely exposed his offensive and defensive IQ. I think he\u2019s still trying to translate NBA game speed in his head but it\u2019s too fast for him right now. Hopefully he spends the offseason watching film and studying the playbook. It\u2019s gotten to a point where when he dribbles the ball, I cringe. He has sooo much potential and is noticeably absorbing as much as he can in a pressure-packed playoff environment tho, so we should give him a break. I think his mobility issue still stems from his back injury and that\u2019s why he is so stiff. There was an article that he\u2019s got dropfoot and is wearing a corrective brace just so he can walk normally, again gotta give the kid a break. Don\u2019t get me wrong, every game I\u2019m yelling thru my TV at MPJ for crowding the driving lane and making boneheaded plays. \nPASS THE BALL! \nSTOP SWITCHING!! \nDON\u2019T.BITE.ON.PUMP-FAKES!!! \n(But he\u2019s going to be special once he gets a full offseason run in with the boys, just wait)\n\n\nAlso, people 100% say Kobe ices out his team mates. Lol", "MPJ has shown he has good off ball instincts. At times the Nuggets offense as a whole gets static and you can tell he doesn't want to make a mistake or step out of his lane. The two biggest things for me are I don't think MPJ has a single play drawn up for him explicitly in the playbook - he has some actions that others have used and he's also done ok, but not like... one play. He also needs to work on his handle, but the kid has feel for the game.", "I agree he definitely has great instincts BUT he\u2019s one step behind the rest of the players on the court right now so even if he knows what\u2019s right and wrong to do technically, it\u2019s not translating on the court. His foot speed is lagging and his handle is like PG\u2019s rookie year. Really really sloppy. I think adjusting to NBA speed takes at least a season to really get a good handle on how your own team mates and opponents move. \n\nI slightly disagree in having plays call for him. I prefer MPJ shooting and getting as many open looks as Millsap or Torrey gets per game for sure. What I see right now is Michael setting flimsy screens as well as running off screens set for him pretty poorly, resulting in broken plays and missed opportunities at open looks IMO. I think that\u2019s why on some possessions they run very basic actions to help get him going.  All I\u2019ll say is it\u2019s a rollercoaster of emotions watching our rookie stud on the floor."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

How many teams would trade their 3rd best player for MPJ? 100% of them, including Lakers and Nets. \n\nNow imagine how may would trade their 2nd best player? The Suns could trade 37 year old CP3 for 5 years of a historically great offensive 23 year old. They would do it in a second. McCollum, yes. DAngelo Russell, yes. JJJ, yes. Jaylen Brown, yes. Porzinger, yes.Hell even the Lakers, in a vacuum would be very very tempted to trade LeBron for MPJ. I\u2019m not saying MPJ is better because I\u2019m not an insane person. But if you can swap 2 years of old ass LeBron and AD for 5 years of AD and MPJ I think you\u2019d really have to think about it. That is a crazy core. Hell even the Jazz would trade Gobert because Gobert is going to be getting 45 million when he\u2019s 34 years old. If you have Mitchell and MPJ locked in for 5 years you can work the edges. The only teams I can\u2019t see doing that would be the Nets because even though Harden is old and fat MPJ and KD is just a weird combo. The other is the Clippers because they could\u2019ve drafted him and to trade PG for MPJ seems like a bad decision.\n\nMy point is that you\u2019re not paying MPJ for what hes done, you\u2019re paying him for his value.

If you've truly accepted the harsh reality like you claim to, stop doing that.\n\nI think most folks' frustration isn't about you guys, it's about the rule system that allows for simultaneously strict and capricious removal of submitted content.

Keeps me from falling asleep", "Sure. But, don\u2019t you think he would be a more effective player if he went into that contact more instead if trying to avoid it with crazy finishes? He\u2019s averaging about 9 drives a game which is sort of average, but he\u2019s only getting to the line a little over 3 times a game which is not good.", "One of the best in the league. I said I\u2019d like him to get to the free throw line more, not that he\u2019s a poor shooter of them.", "I think he DOES go and try to create contact when he is driving, especially when he's making some of those crazy layups, but he like Jokic just doesn't get the call most of the time. I mean just watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Nsy1ukiC8Y), several of these he created the contact and they probably should have been and 1s, ironically the ones where he got the call the contact looked much more minimal than on some of the ones where he didn't. It's a good and bad thing, the good part is that he's not reliant on foul calls to play his game and so that alone is probably part of the reason he plays better in the playoffs because they tend to call way less in the playoffs and the bad part is that it might be hard for him to be a 20+ point scorer in the regular season because he doesn't get to the line, also I worry that he's gonna get hacked on one of these days and get seriously injured [like when he fell when Paul George blocked his shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRwR15OcLRY).", "I think he just doesn't get the calls that other players get. Also, I don't like this newschool create a foul bullshit and I hope the league addresses it. Jumping into defenders or purposely locking your arm around theirs should be an offensive foul, I don't think anyone wants to see players like harden shoot 14 free throws every night", "That\u2019s actually kinda crazy :/ I feel like there\u2019s a reason he does what he does", "I think a lot of the difference in his FTA is that he really doesn\u2019t play the foul baiting game. I think he\u2019s about average in terms of FTA/Drive (at least for guards, I\u2019d have to look it up, also I wonder if bigger guys tend to draw more fouls on them), but he doesn\u2019t really have a high volume of drives like a guy like SGA or Ja, and more importantly he doesn\u2019t play like the guards who do foul hunt outside of drives (Trae, Luka, Harden).\n\nCould he try to play that game? Maybe. Would it help his regular season efficiency and consistency? Probably. But he plays a lot more like Kyrie where he just doesn\u2019t really play that style though, he\u2019d rather try to create his own shot rather than seek out a defender to bait in to fouling him.", "It\u2019s pretty low for someone with his usage/ drives per game. I agree with the Kyrie comp and non fouls seeker behaviour. For Kyrie it\u2019s more of a necessity tho. Kyrie can\u2019t really get up and finish strong so he has to be crafty. Jamal can really get up and finish sometimes. I don\u2019t think Jamal needs to avoid contact as much as he does.", "> It\u2019s pretty low for someone with his usage/ drives per game.\n\nAre you sure? Looking at the tracking data, he takes 4.7 FGA on drives per game (throwing out passes because they\u2019re very unlikely to generate FT), which is 44th in the league. He\u2019s averaging 1.1 FTA per drive, it\u2019s nowhere near Giannis\u2019 3.0 on the same amount of FGA, but overall people taking around the same amount of shots on their drives (between 4.6 and 4.8) are only averaging 1.2 FTA per drive. The guys bringing up that average are mostly bigger guys like Giannis and Bron too. So maybe he could get a few more calls there, but I don\u2019t think it would be many.\n\nEdit - based on L2M report data from 2019 apparently Jamal was kind of getting screwed, both offensively and defensively, by the whistle: https://medium.com/sportsraid/do-nba-superstars-really-get-all-the-calls-basketball-referees-bias-last-two-minute-reports-star-treatment-18123c6d46dd\n\nI thought that was kind of interesting, I wonder if anyone has looked at it since?", "It\u2019s combination of the numbers and eye test for me. When I watch him play I generally feel like he avoids contact of most of the time instead of going into it. He is 65th in free throws per game. I think he has pretty good tools. He\u2019s not super small, pretty strong and can get up a little bit. He shot 61% at rim last year which was great. I mean, players like Fred Van Vleet who have no tools to finish are averaging more free throws. He\u2019s got a lot of finesse to his game, I think he could add a bit more force. I think it\u2019s a bit of low hanging fruit in his game.", "One time he murdered DJ Wilson.\n\nAlso, having watched a lot of VanVleet he generates a lot of calls through getting guys in the air and hunting the foul, like Lowry, more so than generating them through seeking contact on the way to the bucket. I dunno, drawing fouls is a weird and seemingly pretty arbitrary skill, especially for guards. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong in that Murray is probably good enough at finishing through contact that he could seek it out more, I\u2019m not sure how much of a difference it would make though, relying on the ref to blow the whistle can leave you in a tough spot a lot of the time.", "Ohh man that was fantastic. He\u2019s had some monster dunks. I dunno it\u2019s something I have always thought about watching Murray the last few years. He\u2019s been great the last few weeks so hopefully that continues. I really want Jokic to get the MVP, we need to go on a run for our big boy to make it happen. I\u2019m gonna be sad when they give LeBron the lifetime achievement award when Jokic is dominating the advanced stats the way he is."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

Bam would be lucky to have that caliber of a career injuries or no injuries.  Bam is great but he's no Hall of Famer.", ">His game actually reminds me a bit of Jokic\n\nIn terms of passes they can do? Absolutely. Bam can definitely sell that no look behind the back to a cutter, as well as hit them consistently with that bounce pass from the high post. Utilizes height advantage really well too.\n\nBut I still think Bam is more of an 'extra pass' guy that is especially dangerous in transition as opposed to a true floor general and elite halfcourt player that is Jokic... especially since he has the benefit of playing with a very disciplined squad led by coach Spo, while Yoke initially had to deal with a lot of experiments out of Malone's lab (seeing how well we turned out, I don't think we should be holding them against him anymore, even if he could be very stubborn at points haha), a lack of proper backcourt playmaker until Jamal started making progress and a lot of inconsistencies that come with the roster being so young and not necessarily having proper vet leadership at times.\n\nWith all that said, Bam only turned 23 recently and I must admit that Jokic didn't really turn into a true floor general and proper leader of the team until the 2nd half of the 2017-18 I'd say, and truly established himself as one of the best in the league last season... if anyone kept doubting him after that, this season and the playoffs should've shut them up lol.", "You have to factor in the West East difference.  Every player in the east has inflated stats because they play crap teams every night.  This East stat inflation made Pascal Siakam look like a superstar.  So Bam averaged 16/10/5 and 18/11/5 in the playoffs.  Those are great numbers but when you factor in the talent gap they are actually just good numbers. Jokic would be putting up a clean 25/13/9 against the same teams.  Against the Lakers, I know he only played 21 minutes, but Bam didn't get a single assist and played like shit overrall.  If this season as thought me one thing, who you play matters.   When you factor that in, Bam will never be at a HOF level, honestly he's just a top 10 center.", "I love Star Wars", "Idk, I don\u2019t think this success from Bam is a fluke. He\u2019s has all the assets to be the perfect modern center. He can space the floor. He\u2019s quick enough to guard other positions. And he still has the size to play in the post. Embiid is slow and can\u2019t really space the floor, he almost seems like a relic from a different era. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy to put Bam above Embiid. \n\n Jokic is basically in his own category, no one\u2019s ever played center like him. Bam is good but he isn\u2019t close to the Joker", "Sixers fan dropping in... Thanks for sticking up for our guy lol.  Taking Bam over him seems insane to me.. it's Jokic and Joel for 1 2", "Well seeing as how there\u2019s only like 5 centers that are really a factor in the NBA currently it\u2019s not really that hard. Jokic is by far the best then you have uhhhh.... I guess Embiid? KAT is also very good but really plays more as a PF which is the same case with Porzingis and AD. If all three of those guys counted though then AD is obviously better than Embiid and I would also put KAT over him because he stays healthy and he\u2019s a better shooter. KP is potentially also better than Embiid but he can\u2019t stay healthy. Bottom line is there are quite a few people at Embiid\u2019s level but very few good centers in general", "Bam certainly isn't the scorer Amar'e was, but there are plenty of bigs in the Hall who weren't either. He's one of the best passing bigs in the game rn, and is a great defensive player.\n\nAs for being an all-star in the West, I feel like you could ask that about almost any player outside of the superstar tier. The team you end up on is just luck of the draw outside of free agency.", "bam is 10x times the player amar'e was on defense though\n\nthat being said, embiid and definitely jokic is better than bam rn", "See, that\u2019s a decent take. Stating decent points instead of just saying \u201cEmbiid is phony\u201d as if he hasn\u2019t been dominant on both ends of the floor when he\u2019s been healthy.

Like do you get a discount on your tax bill when you sign one of your own unrestricted free agents?\n\nOnly downside I guess is he wouldn\u2019t be free to rehab with the team?

He has played anything from PG to PF on a regular basis and has also fully bought into Jokic-ball with his timely cuts and selflessness. \n\nI also personally feel for him, given that he tore his ACL in Denver, potentially passing up a decent sim of money going into his FA year.\n\nIn time to come we will all logically agree that it\u2019s the best move but just for a short moment I wanted to take the time to appreciate someone that has given up so much for the franchise.", "As a part of Collective 7 he is legend in his own right.", "Huh?

They will look for another guy like PJ 3 years ago. A 2-way guy looking for a chance.

There are some ridiculous facts that everyone ignores as long as \"serbs are criminals\" narrative is fulfilled. For example the fact that 3 separate news reporters and observers, reported 8000 armed bosniaks and 4000 civilians in Srebrenica, against 1500 serbs with no heavy vehicles, and with several grenade launchers 2 days before the event, while at least 2 separate observers reported more than 10.000 bosniaks leaving the location the night before the attack - either Serbian units were 1500 Rambos to attack 12k, or the narrative of 8k killed is false. There's a nice book by an independent Swiss journalist, Alexander Dorin, who proved that 3500 of alleged Srebrenica victims are killed before or after (war lasted for 7 years), and more than 1500 are still alive today living in Canada, USA, and Australia. Literally, there is a name on the \"wall of dead\", and the dude is alive and well, farming somewhere outside Wellington \n\nMothers of Srebrenica are a bunch of women, who are abusing their foundation to such an extent, that they all drive Audi Q7, in a country where Fiat Punto is a luxury, and even Bosnian people hate those crows for abusing the Srebrenica story for their own personal gain. It goes so far that several members of \"mothers\" are not even related to dead people. But that doesnt stop them from appearing everywhere where there's a chance to collect on war damage-reapir goods, and royalties and other finances for their foundation \n\nNow imagine from Serbian perspective, how does it look like when someone rubs that in your face constantly, 25 years after, especially when you know that more than 6000 serbs were decapitated, burned alive, raped, dismembered, and other (there is an online NSFW gallery with detailed description and proof which I do not want to share cause no one should look at that), by the same guys Nurkic wore on his shirt, which western media didnt care to report so that Srebrenica narrative wouldnt be diluted", "Half of this sub does not dislike MPJ lol", "I mean ultimately the situation is not what caused the issues - it was Nurkic's behavior.

You quit on my team I never forgive you", "Naw, have you seen his post game antics? Dude is a high school bully with a platform. Ya he's good at basketball but his personality sucks so I'ma hate him.", "Yeah, makes sense seeing their performance yesterday against our c team. \n\nWhat you thinking about the match next week against the clippers? (In the scenario that our injured players will be back by then)", "Listen, I hope no one here  will get offended by what I will say, but I personally don't accept the \"we didn't kill X civilians, we barely killed Y civilians\" argument and \"we didn't killed them all at once, it took us many years to kill them\", even if there was some kind of crazy conspiracy theory to add up victims to make us poor Serbs look bad. I don't care even if we killed 10 civilians, it's our shame no metter how much the other sides have killed. First, war crimes is not a contest to count who killed more - to each their own shame. Secondly, and it's far worse for me, the idea to kill Muslims had and still has very strong presence in our culture, and it was not only during the recent war, we took our chance in WW2 to try to \"get rid of the Turks\" when there were also troops that would rather go around and \"clean the country\" than fight against Nazis. Sure, \"communist propaganda\", but not once I witnessed people brag about those killings and take pride in the slaughter while being \"good Christians\" at the same time. I don't feel better knowing that Serbs were killed too. We took our chance again in Bosnia in the '90s and again in Kosovo in' 98-'99. I don't care about world conspiracies when someone was secretly transporting bodies from Kosovo to a mass grave in Vojvodina in fucking refrigerator trucks (remember the \"frikombinuju\" joke?? ) and 20 years later nobody even talks about it. That kind of shit was very real and had a strong support amongst our people. Sadly, it's a fact. Noone tricked us into killing innocent people, we were raised to hate them. And we are still not raising kids to be better, we still teach them to be ignorant. The same goes to other nations, we are not special in that regard. Hitler was successful because millions of German, Polish, Slovak, Hungarian, Croatian etc people were genuanily accepting the idea of white Arian supremacy and were ready to kill for it. He just abused the evil human nature imo. Racism in US? Same thing. Who tricked superior Europeans into enslaving Africa? I don't care exactly how many people are killed in Srebrenica. I will teach my kid to understand the evil behind it and not support or deny a genocide. If one is blinded by hate towards other skin color, religion or nation, and is ready to kill for his beliefs, he's not a Serb, Croat or Bosnian, he's just a piece of shit. But Srebrenica is not a narrative, it's our shame which we have to accept and put effort to build society where that shit can never happen again. Same goes for others. We cannot affect how they raised a kid in Bosnia or Croatia, but we can affect how we raise our kids here and now. Why do we care what cars Mothers of Srebrenica are driving? Look at the idiots ruling our country. What cars are they driving?", "Don't be Nurkic dude, no one is interested here about our petty conflicts, people want to discuss basketball.", "There ain't no narrative about Srebrenica genocide my man, there is only one truth that was well documented and and the perpetrators got their sentence for said GENOCIDE.\n\nAnd other Denver fans should ask themselves in what kind of company they are, where straight apologetic bullshit denying of the biggest war crime in Europe in recent history, is massively upvoted.", "I would say most dislike his views(I do too), there was a lot of backlash over the covid thing.\n\nMaybe they\u2019re hyped for him as a ball player but those beliefs are harmful.", "What post game antics?", "Honestly... no fucking clue. The nuggets are so hard to gauge right now with all the missing players. Do they come back? If so do they come back strong or rusty? Jamal came off an injury this year and exploded out of the gate, but 3 players coming back? Barton and Harris have been historically slow to regain form after injuries. \n\nThen there's the MPJ situation. Do we pull the trigger and start him regardless? Barton or Harris off the bench (should be Barton)? How does that impact rotations? What's the closing lineup? Do players accept their new rolls? Do they adapt to new rolls quickly? \n\nSo many unknowns. I wouldn't feel comfortable betting either direction on the nuggets right now, put it that way", "Well said", "See, I dont agree with you \n\nYou are constantly insisting on \"our shame\", not taking into account that it was A WAR, and you dont wage a war by standing in place, but rather taking strategic areas, and killing opposite soldiers in order to do so - if by shame you mean waging a war then ok\n\nSee, I am not pulling these facts from the upper post out of my ass - I actually have a relative who was present at the time. Dutch general, that was stationed as a part of UN forces, called Serbian leaders to congratulate them on a well devised victory, close time aftermath didnt include any kind of \"genocide and killings of innocent, but rather a well executed army attack. Said general even confirmed that in Hague as a special witness \n\n>I will teach my kid to understand the evil behind it and not support or deny a genocide\n\nI am very sad to hear this, but you must know that British government along with Hague court, are the ones who are calling it Genocide in the first place - and by all means, by all standards, it can not, and will never be a genocide. \n\nBoko Haram, is currently counting 300.000 dead Nigerians, still not proclamed genocide. British army killed more than 800.000 civilians AFTER WW2, still not called for what they are. \n\nIf you are willing to accept the obvious finger-pointing by those who are much much worse, and say things such as: \n\n>I don't care even if we killed 10 civilians, it's our shame no metter how much the other sides have killed\n\nThen I feel sorry for you. I understand that ANY war crime and attrocity should never happen, but you must not allow for western narratives to succeed, and paint your whole nation as savages - which you will eventually do, by teaching your kid that \n\nI urge you to read Alexander Dorin's book - Truth About Srebrenica, and maybe then you will realize the magnitude of a hoax executed, and how CIA with UN staged the whole thing for the sole purpose of labeling one whole nation as war criminals. You maybe can accept that - I wont, especially after hearing stories from people that were actually there. Do you even realize that people who killed most people in the world history (UK), are the ones actually pushing agenda for Serbs to be called Genocidal ? Dont you get even slightly mad about that ? Should I tell you the story of redrawing Indian borders and how 300.000 died of starvation on a one man's whim ? or maybe how they killed thousands on Cyprus ? \n\nYou may  accept the fact that whole world is calling us criminals, and have peace with it. I wont, because I know the extent of the fabricated story. Maybe one day your kid will have a duty to guard his own land, and he will realize the importance of it, the things he may need to do to defend it, the people he needs to keep safe, no matter what his father told him.", "Agree with you, but shining some light isn't that bad if someone is willing to read and be a bit more open minded.", "I\u2019m pretty interested. I\u2019ve only really heard the Bosnian stories of the war so to get a Serbian perspective is nice.", "I am extremely interested, because War is hell and all stories deserve to be told. \n\nAs an American there is much that I will never find out or be exposed to. I appreciate his write-up and will be doing my own research to see what else I can find out.", "He's not denying it. The other side overblown it out of proportions and made a circus out of it. As someone who lives 8 miles away from Srebrenica, I heard story or two about it.", "Biggest war crime is 250k Serbs cleansed from Croatia.  Too bad you wouldn't say that..\ud83e\udd2b", "That's fair.", "Mostly I think of the game post Kobe's death where Dame went off and killed the Lakers. People were trying to talk about the win and Kobe but he was just hanging on to Dame trying to get on camera and in general being annoying when he had nothing to do with the game.", "Completely get you man and thank you for your patience in explaining with details. I agree with you completely. We'll have to wait and see for new news regarding their injuries and when they're gonna start practicing again. Has to be soon though since playoffs are around the corner. \nThank again man", "You are right about one thing , all kind of agendas do exist. I will obviously not teach my kid that Serbs are savages. War itself is not a shame for a nation, and I will still proudly talk about heroics from our history. But any killing of unarmed civilians, especially women and children, IS a shame. And any planned and organized, supported with logistics, mass deportation and murders are ethnic cleansing and genocide no metter what was the victim toll and no metter how you call it. Maybe there is truth to what you say about Srebrenica, but there is also more than enough evidence of crimes that did happen, without going into semantics of word 'genocide'. I am very well aware of the Croatian, Bosnian, Albanian crimes, but to me it doesn't justify someone doing the same in my name. Again, I'm not talking about killing soldiers in war. I'm talking about blood thirsty criminals that consciously and willingly killed civilians. And if we are not doing everything to make that difference and we call them heroes instead (just like those T-shirt criminals are heroes for Nurkic), than we support what they did. And what they did is also documented very well. You know, where Im from the Turks ruled until fucking 1912, and my family was fighting in hajduks, in WW1, WW2, and protecting their homes. I will always proudly speak to my kid about that. But at the same time, some members of my family and other people from my village, were robbing and burning nearby Muslim villages, and bragging about women they raped and children they killed. They didn't see any wrong with that. That was in WW2. And the exact same kind of people from my village went happily to Bosnia in 90s and came back with the same stories like their fathers did 50 years earlier. \"we killed all Turks in village X, not one is left\". I'm sorry, but being very proud of my ancestors that like you said laid their lives to PROTECT their families, I'm more mad at the bastards from same blood who were after innocent people and all about \"killing all the Turks\" than I could be ever mad at some invisible agenda makers from UK. To me, that is the shame. The ones fighting in the war as honest and proud Serbian soldiers I am not ashamed of. I hope you  can understand my point of view. I sure hope that my kid or future kids will not have to exowrience war, but even if they will, they will surely know the the difference between the soldier and the criminal.", "Yes he is, Serbian apologetic handbook 101. More than 8000 civilians killed and thousands of displaced, what about it is made a circus of. Only circus is the attitude of many Serbs towards said crime. If you live where you say you live you should know better.", "He\u2019s not allowed to celebrate his friend going off and winning the game? Obviously it wasn\u2019t a good time in the one clip but he didn\u2019t know that.", "I know it's 9 days after this comment was posted, but I wanted to point out one thing you are ignoring is that it was a civil war, 3 sided, with only one army involved. No matter how you put it, after the fight, it was always army killing civilians.\n\nNow tell me what does a person carrying a gun with no uniform becomes after death? A dead civilian. \n\nBut when those hands are holding arms, these are no civilians. Remember most of people kill at the spot in Srebrenica were men from 15-60 years, so in reality those man could have been killed in fight or they could have been executed after disarming (still wrong, but gives completely different perspective).", "I know better, hence the reason I agree with him. What about 100k \"displaced\" Serbs from Sarajevo?! \n\nThis is Bosniaks victim, mercy seeking handbook 101.", "You are right, if they are armed *and* organized as a military unit (to destinguish from people having guns at home for protection), they are not civilians. The perspective of Srebrenica may be different than the official one, but it sucks that we as society are still not able to deal with the past in a way that is not causing more hate and conflicts in the future. And that is sadly the same way in all post-war societies here, not just Serbian. A good example imo is CNA organization (Center for Non-violent Action) that brings together war veterans from all sides of Balkan conflicts, but this kind of work should also be institutionalized not stigmatized as 'traitors'. That's why I don't like all these dead counting and conspiracy theories. If Mothers of Srebrenica really are some crazy war profiters and a plot to make Serbs look bad, that's their problem.", "Nah, I'm not going there.

Jamal as the ball handler and point guard should have attacked the basket and made his intention clear. Mpj should have come in for a trailing dump pass.

I think he's just trying to take the heat off MPJ, but the other two could have gotten a layup too if they see where MPJ went", "His plan was to bring Beal to him which happened and he would pass to mpj for a easy dunk but, mpj ran to the corner", "From what I saw of the play, MPJ was way ahead of the play and open under the rim, he should've stayed, Facu was well positioned and is it Morris the 4th player? He should've been in the corner (he positioned well in the situation), that way there will be an open player. In any other situation Murray has to drive, but in this one being the last player to run the floor he should've passed and much earlier imo, if MPJ gets the mark he passes to the open shooter that would include Jamal as well coming to the top of the key.", "Did you want Moach to take a timeout?

Since Beal is a horrific defender, Jamal should have just taken it straight to the basket at an open lane, Beal wasn't even squared up. But yeah, MPJ and Facu definitely should both have gone to the basket for a  pass.\n\nThe fault rests on all of them, it's stupid to blame it entirely on MPJ.", "Beal is guarding MPJ at the start of the break and MPJ holds him wide by running to the corner, he just doesn't adjust when Beal peels off. Murray needs to drive to the rim until they stop him. I think if he's going to pull up he has to shoot it. Honestly, there's a million different ways to score a 4 v 1, you have to make a chain of bad decisions to fuck it up", "I know that we constantly underperform on fast breaks. So maybe we should actually spend some time on it instead of just expecting players to know how to deal with it. Our teams situational awareness is awful in clutch situations. Look at the torry craig layup in the playoffs last year.", "Lol okay buddy", "That's fair. I think it may come down to the style of delivering critique, but I don't necessarily expect people to coddle him, either.", "You should watch the play we're talking about. You'll see Jamal force the defender choose to close out or protect the rim. Had Beal chose to protect the rim, Jamal surely would've shot. Instead Beal closed out, and Jamal went to throw an easy lob to the rim, but nobody cut. He was forced to make an awkward pass to an unexpecting Facu. Seriously, you should check out the play you're commenting on, because you've obviously not watched it.", "Huh?", "Came here for this. I feel like IQ already had the confidence to take that last shot too", ">  it's stupid to blame it entirely on MPJ.\n\nThere is nothing to blame on MPJ. He did his job, spaced the floor for the drive. Murray is at fault, end of story.", "That's the thing though, it's not like Beal is some elite defender that you let dictate where you're going with the ball. Jamal had an open lane and should've attacked and there's a 99% chance one of the following happens - Murray makes a layup, gets two free throws or kicks it out to MPJ in the corner for 3. That's it. The other 1% would've just been a pull up 3. There's absolutely no reason he should've picked up his dribble in transition though. He can still make any pass off the dribble or decide to shoot if nobody is cutting. I'm not disagreeing that MPJ or somebody else *should've* cut, but his options were severely limited by choosing to pick up his dribble. \n\nEither way, it sucks they lost like that but I'm sure they'll learn from it and move on.", "There are now many examples of people reading lips of these guys on the court, examples of coach and team ganging up on MPJ, and Murray's tendency to sometimes make blame-y comments. So I say \"Huh?\" to you.", "Space the floor for what? It was a 4 v 1 and he was out ahead of everybody. He needs to be cutting to the WIDE OPEN basket.", "it's stupid to put no blame whatsoever on MPJ.", "ur just plain wrong lmao the easiest thing is for mpj to drive towards the basket, murray got beal to come toward him, but mpj dumbass ran to the corner because the thinks hes steph curry and not only threw murray off guard but also gave time for beal and the other defender to pressure murray into a bad pass to facu. if murray was a better player he could have taken beal on but this is all mpjs fault", "Yes, you're correct that in hindsight he should've driven to the basket. In real time, it was 100000% the right move, he got Beal to do exactly what he wanted, and his teammates screwed up.

They don\u2019t know what to do inside the paint.", "Yes, you see they are taught to go to the outside to open up the floor during transitions, but in this situation there is literally NOBODY in the lane, it's a god damn 4 v 1, but out of habit and low IQ he decided to do it in this situation. MPJ has always had low bbiq.", "Dish to a corner in 4v1? Lol", "Even if Murray goes to the bucket, which he probably should have, MPJ should still be there for the dump off or put back, three guys on the perimeter in that situation is pointless.", "Lmao people actually think dishing to a corner 3 down 2 in the final seconds is better than dishing to a 6\u201910\u201d MPJ wide open under the basket\n\nLike don\u2019t get me wrong that shot goes in nobody\u2019s complaining but you take the wide open layup every single time", "You do understand he dished to a corner anyhow?", "Right? You kick it out in the third quarter. You take the easy dunk down 2 with 2.5 seconds left at home", "Came here only because of this dumb MPJ play, but boy this comment is top notch stupid. You do realise that he passed to a corner because there was no one going to basket?", "He didn't even do that. Murray threw it to the wing, and that was only because everyone else left him with no other options. Murray is the only one that isn't at fault, end of story.", "He should be the one going to the basket, think about what you are saying. He has Beal with 5 fouls on him...", "Number of fouls definitely matters when there is 1 second on the clock. He should not be going to the basket. If MPJ went to the basket there is zero doubt that there would be a wide open lay up. I don't care if I get banned but the stupidity of yours is astounding.", "Your argument is as weak as the amount of ad hominem you are using. He should absolutely be going to the basket, every great point guard is rushing to the basket to score a layup, force an and-1 or force a defender to contest which is why MPJ can stand in the corner and wait for the pass. \n\nBut go on, continue insulting random posters on the internet.", "The fact that you can't comprehend the obvious is so ridiculous. Everyone with half brain on this thread or r/nba thread can see that MPJ had an open lay-up, but you still try to make it seem that going for a contested hero play lay-up would have been a better choice. Dunno how can I call stubborness like this not bein stupid.", "Most analysts have said it's Murray's fault.

He stood where Malone is telling him to stand, and his position was good enough to receive the pass when Murray brings the ball to the basket. Murray is a point guard on max contract.

Lebron and Harden are amazing too but so much of their passing prowess comes from beating their man off the dribble and forcing help from the other team.\n\n\n\nJokic will chill with his back to basket 15ft away and thread the needle to a cutter for an easy bucket.

The only category Embiid is better in is defense. I like Embiid but Jokic is more clutch, makes his teammates better, more creative, more available.", "No argument no", "I think you sort of answered your question. I would say embiid could definitely be the best player on his team, but he's not the team in the way jokic is because he's not nearly as smart. Everything revolves around jokic because he's good enough to carry a team entirely on his shoulders. In other words I think that jokic as the single star on a team would do better than embiid simply because he makes everyone else better by being on the floor with them. If embiid could stay healthier it would be a little closer though.", "It\u2019s not even just the assists, it\u2019s all the other passes he makes that lead to assists or set up the whole offense", "Sabonis has played one more year and Jokic only has 1500 more career assists.\n\nI have read that they were more strict about what counted as an assist back in the day so it would so I do wonder what Bill Russell's career numbers would have been if he played today (ignoring all the other issues with comparing eras).", "Uhhh...

FireMalone is very much a meme at this point. The other is the old box theory. Malone is clearly one of the better coaches in the league. But he is not unanimously the best. So why not fire him and hire a new coach? He might even be as good as Malone! Hell, he might be better! Never mind that most head coaches struggle to last 3 years in the league, and most of them don't pan out, and teams settle for coaches worse than Malone by a fair bit because the stability that brings is still far better than getting into the coaching carrousel year after year.", "I love Malone and I'm happy he's extended.

There are some flaws that become evident after watching some games, like stubbornness with rotations and playing certain people too long. But I think he has shown that he can learn and make the correct choices.

There have been a lot of examples of this over the years (Torrey Craig being a huge asset in this kind of mis-managing lineups, as a prominent example).\n\nThat being said every coach has their strengths and weaknesses and no one is perfect.

To assume it would have happened regardless is unfair.\n\nThe mindset from development to winning can take two different skillsets. Managing personalities (especially AFTER winning), managing rest, making playoff adjustments...oh and completely revamping the offense when he got there should all count.

High energy, Uber athletic, OREB machine and scoring attitude. I see why he was so loved in Denver. I'm glad he's not on the Bucks right now and in that embarrassing series again the Nets.", "I really don't see Ayton as a problem for Jokic. I mean the first half he had rebounds, assists and hit most of his shots. \n\nThe problem was the fact that anytime the ball was in somebody else's hands that somebody either turned it over or bricked an open shot. The shooting percentages for anyone except Joker and Will were atrocious. If they hit half of those shots we'd have been up by 7 points.", "Add in a few more arrows for the COL-VGK series. Painnnnn", "Coach Malone needs to bring some fresh sets to game 3 because the Suns are having zero trouble defending the Nuggets so far. \n\nIf you can't generate good offense you giving up more transition looks, Nuggets already have poor transition defense, like... you can't be generating inefficient offense and also struggling to defend and expect to get anything other than swept. \n\nLet's see what adjustments Malone and his staff can make.

I even wrote on this sub, with people criticizing me for it, that he is superb player.

The one time they really doubled today, Crowder got a steal. Seemed like he was genuinely surprised Crowder was going to be there, since I'm these last two games Suns aren't sending a second defender. Ayton is doing an okay job by himself.\n\nAgainst other teams, Jokic either scores at will, or they double and he finds an open shooter. Part of the issue with shooting is people are taking more contested shots and the reason, is in my view, that Ayton is holding his own. Jokic PPG is down in this series compared to the last (obviously) but also compared to reg season.", "Ayton is a massive problem dude", "well\u2026. don\u2019t do that again.", "get him boys", "Roster spot iirc", "It was loud as fuck the last game in Ball I don't think that's a fair assessment.", "Milwaukee sure could use him too.", "It\u2019s not even really our fault. We wanted to keep Grant, Grant led us to believe he was staying, TC was a casualty to get money to keep Grant, we let him walk thinking we are going to sign Grant, then Grant said sike and TC was already gone.", "I mean didn't the Nuggets kind of have too many mouths to feed anyway? \n\nIf Murray wasn't injured I think this series would look different. I'm not saying I would favor Denver but he would help with the struggling offense, that's for sure. He could also check CPIII on the defensive end.", "Imagine we lose because he missed a layup and you end up hating him, weird how it goes", "Hes always been a championship type player.

Instead going on him in 1st half we decided to brick 3s", "The Blazers didn't double.", "yup.  First game, Suns has solid clamps.  Game 2:  JFC no one could throw it into the ocean.  \n\n\nSuns are good, very good, but Nuggets beat themselves game 2.", "Yes, but I'd still much rather have AG than Harris and TC personally.", "I see what you are saying, but i also think his PPG is down because in both games he played much less than usual. Only 30 minutes in the last game because they were getting blown out.\n\nHad the other players shot the ball better and kept the game close Jokic would have logged in extra 8-10 minutes which would definitely raise his PPG.\n\nIn any case, those two games are in the past, we can just hope they switch it it for the remainder of the series.", "Lesson learned.", "They have been great when things are good. Just frustrated with the negative mentality when the team is down.", "We traded him for cash to get PJ Tucker, one of our starters are out for the rest of the playoffs and I really miss him right now. It was unfortunate too, he was out with an injury at the start and never got the chance to be implemented into the lineup fully.", "It was expected of PJ Dozier to fill his role.", "Craig was so cheap look at his contracts. Better have him then -Shaq/Cancar etc . And i like Cancar as well", "And how did that work out for them?", "100%. I love the moves our FO made since last season's playoffs, genuinely think we have one of the best in the league.  \n\n\nIt's like when you are dating a girl, who's a really, really nice person but there just isn't a spark. Genuine affection but it's just not really working. So then you break up amicably. Six months later you see her dating someone else when you're kind of down on your luck at the time. You're super happy for her because she found someone she likes, but at the same time, there's some sadness there too.  \n\n\nThat's a Torrey Craig 3.  \n\n\nIf we lose to the Suns, definitely rooting for them to go all the way. Would be really great if Gary finds his shot again in Orlando, but not sure if that will happen. Rooting for him tho.", "Well we didn\u2019t shoot 13% that series. I agree with oc.

I thought we wouldn't be able to sign anyone (or anyone for as much money) because we have Jordan now, but if it's just a matter of waiving him and having to pay more for someone at the same pay we could have paid him before Jordan, that's a small cost and one the Kroenkes should absolutely be willing to swallow if they're serious about this being a win-now window.\n\nI'm fine with whatever depth players we have for now **_if_** we can avoid exhausting the starters (Jamal and MPJ coming back from injury, & I never again want Nikola to have to carry the entire team on his back for so long so he's ready to really turn it on through a deep playoff run).\n\nBy playoffs, obviously the role players are going to be critical for us to win vs different teams who present different challenges.", "More likely to use that trade exception sometime in the season and just cut DJ.", "Right, that\u2019s why I said his 3pt shooting being up and down is concerning: 40 / 28 / 34 / 25 over his career.\n\nLast year is great but there is a lot of inconsistency.

Went to a school that had a better health center and rehab facility than most colleges. Spent an entire semester and the summer rehabbing so I\u2019d be ready to go the next school year. The mental hurdle was the toughest. Any slight overextension or slip and I\u2019d mentally check out the rest of the game because I wanted to play it safe. I\u2019m probably even more athletic now than I was then; jump higher, run faster, etc. (of course I\u2019m playing rec league now so it\u2019s only to keep in shape lol) but it\u2019s definitely difficult. Nearly a decade later and I STILL get more tightness in the leg that had the tear. A torn ACL is something that a player can 110% come back from and perhaps barely, if at all, lose a step. However, the body remembers everything and as a human, you\u2019ll naturally try to play it safe to avoid it happening again.\n\nI lowered my expectations at the beginning of this season as soon as MPJ went out, so I\u2019m not too disappointed after last night. Jokic is getting the MVP and we made the playoffs again with a team that outside of Jokic is definitely a top-3 lottery pick squad. I actually laughed (but still loved the optimism) of fellow fans who claimed we\u2019d finally win it all this year. Crazier things have happened, but come on. The last time an MVP-caliber player had no help and still made the finals was Bron in \u201807. Then before that, I\u2019m pretty sure the last time a player won it all while his co-star was out was Magic his first year. I\u2019d rather Murray and MPJ rest (without the pressure from fans and media screaming for their return) and come back 90-100% next year than rush back and get hurt again (like KD in 2019)", "Many of us have had life altering injuries.

If Murray was back it is very likely jokic doesn\u2019t win mvp again. I don\u2019t see why people put so much weight on the award. The way I see it.

(It doesn't measure defense at all)  But if you look at on/off date Nuggets played far better Defense when MPJ was on the court compared to when Grant was on the court.  That could just be starter vs bench lineups though. But it's not like Grant had a high Defensive real plus minus or a defensive Box plus minus in the regular season.  Basically advance stats measure Grant as a overrated defender who doesn't make the impact defensively people think he does.  He's more or less an average NBA starter level defender.  Considering Lebron dropped 30 point triple doubles on his head twice I think that makes sense, at least to me.", "I would argue Defense in that clippers series was a team effort.  Grant was average but because the team was together we got stops and Grant got most of the credit.  Also, it needs to be said, for a PF grant is a bad rebounder.   Sorry but it's true.   And yes I think we can get someone who is above average on defense AND player good offense for cheap if we play it right.

You somehow drive less and average a higher percentage of free throws from said drives. \n\nBut that\u2019s both of our Playoff statistics on average across every series this postseason. Our series specifically? We averaged 52.6 drives per game and 20.8 FGA/9.6 FTA on those drives. Therefore, 18% of our drives resulted in free throws (1 FTA per 5.5 drives).

By now, I assume most fans are privy to the narrative that more FTA from one team means bias towards said team.

Ownership got rid of Doc, there is a feeling now that with the top end talent they have everyone who stays needs to get on board with knowing their role. They will want a ball handling/shot creating guard. \n\nWarriors - A year and a half off to rest and rehab for Curry and Klay (Draymond played only ~40 games himself) is probably just what the doctor ordered for them after five straight finals runs, we know how good that core is, Wiggins is athletic and can score, they've reloaded the bench, I'll be surprised if they are not a top 4 seed in the west and threat to *any* team in a seven game series.

They have assets to improve and a great young core. If healthy they have a shot at the ECFs and even a finals berth. \n\nBucks - Giannis is a great player but the Bucks haven't been able to put a truly contending team around him.
