I\u2019m super happy with the Gordon trade and Fournier has an expiring contract I I get that, but we could\u2019ve gotten more for Vuc and if we couldn\u2019t of, it would\u2019ve been better to keep him, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying", "No they couldn't. If they could they would have gotten more.\n\nThis is what I mean about Magic fans being unrealistic.\n\nBig men aren't valued in the NBA. offense are more uo and down the court. Vooch wasn't that type of player.\n\nWhich is why the Magic traded him. They want to be a more read and react style offense.

We never heard him talk badly about the other players or front office to the media or on twitter. He carried himself with dignity, while being triple teamed and losing easy winnable games. Not once has he not tried to encourage the young players on court, in fact I remember many instances of him looking at Fultz or Chuma and trying to set them up for points. The time chuma made like one three during the game, Vuc fed him for the rest of the game and Chuma hit buckets and stood in the game till the end of game closing it out for us. Similarily he lets Fultz direct the team in the end of games.\n\nHe is a leader but he is letting the players develop, of course its prob slower than just throwing them to the fire like what is happening now.

Also, if you wait til Summer, you'd have to pick up Fultz's options in order to retain him.  Then you'd have to wait months before you could move him.  The longer you wait, the less value he has.  Also, if the market for him was great, 76ers would have taken more.\n\n... it is what it is.  Both Magic and 76ers did what worked in their timeline.  ", "No one knows.

Even if he doesn't pan out, we traded an SG that we were barely playing and declined this year, and late first that may become 2 second and a mid second. It could bite us in the butt, thought highly unlikely any of that becomes anything worth it. On the other hand, if we can ever figure out what is wrong with fultz, he could be an All-Star talent as he was drafted as one of the best in his class. Even if he only becomes half the player he was and never gets back his full shot, he's probably better than what we have right now.

The kid is the biggest bust in nba history, don\u2019t let these Fultz fans convince you that he\u2019s an nba player let alone special. He\u2019s not injured, never was injured it\u2019s all mental. How come a doctor hasn\u2019t put his name to the \u201ctos diagnosis\u201d? How come he was fine until he got benched for TJ? How come he can do cartwheels and dunk?

I strongly believe he would have gotten more love in this sub without sincerelyfan annoyingly overpacing.\nHowever, seems a really nice person and I hope he get a shot at a ring.", "This honestly makes me depressed. I truly think Mo was a winning player and was given a raw deal on this team. He was given unrealistic expectations from the get-go from Clifford. He was put behind Khem Birch despite having better defensive and offensive numbers but Mo clearly did have more lapses as a rookie which I understand is annoying, but he was a rookie and should have been given time to grow. Especially with the players this team had who were willing to teach on the court. \n\nKhem Birch isnt terrible but MO was doing so much more in the minutes he played some games. Mo just felt like a great prospect that was never explored from Clifford. And then he had injuries and the likes which further slowed his development. \n\nLast season was the only true season that Mo was allowed to develop, and it was completely positive. MO looked fantastic; he had defensive numbers that put him closer to top 10 defender in the league than top 20. He was a leading rim protector and showed growing offensive potential as a top 3pt shooting center (top 5) with high volume something along the lines of 38% on 5 3PA per game. Mo was a knockdown 3pt shooter with high level defense and was fitting in perfectly with Wendell. We saw the future and the future looked bright and growing. Everybody knew last season was a tank year. The Magic intentionally tanked and was better than the record. \n\nSomehow this season the coach and players in their embracing of Bol completely imo skipped steps. Bol was instantly put into the SL (which was clearly a mistake since the coach decided to axe that and put Bol into a limited role player position). Bol was granted the SL position with no type of system of accountability. Bol was allowed to fail. He had so many games of being a liability and a blackhole that was given a blanket statement from fans of \"this is essentially his rookie year\" while Mo was also barely allowed to get pt. It was unfair treatment, but the world is unfair, and the team clearly had a plan. I just don't understand their plan honestly. Bol, I guess made some excitement but now it feels like more and more people have high expectations of Bol and when he doesn't do it or fail like usual, they are even more disappointed. \n\nMo should have started from the beginning of this season, and I truly think this team not only wins more but Paolo and Franz develop quicker and better. Bol was truly that bad early on. He was such a liability it caused problems for everybody. It's even worse after thinking about the fact that Mo was good in his limited minutes and usage. He was the main facilitator at the top of the arc, he had the best p/m on this team majority of the year, was the top 2 best shooter (maybe its G Harris), has the best defensive metrics for bigs, and has the best differential. \n\nMo this year came so much better than last but nobody but a few who actually pay attention noticed it. Mo has not been a disappointment to me as a fan of the Magic, I have been disappointed in the Magic FO that have not been able to find a balance to developing young players and their team. So much favoritism happens on this team it's ridiculous. Suggs rookie year start was plagued with Cole isoing and shooting 100 shots and only passing to Suggs once the shotclock was down to 3 secs. It's bad optics the way this team allowed some players to be on no leash and others on a short leash. \n\nI remember one specific game this year that had Cole at -20 in like 10 mins and the rest of the bench around -15. Mo had like -12 in 8 mins. Mo got benched the rest of that game. Cole did not despite at the time it was the perimeter getting torched, players were shooting lights out and then blowing by Admiral and Cole on every switch easily attacking the rim. Mo somehow took the brunt of the blame online. Cole ended game like -22. How is that fair. Its not. \n\nMo will be great on the Lakers. It's just going to be disappointing when fans here act surprised the same way they did with VO. Mo was never given any opportunities and its not because there were none to give considering the amount of shots Bol/Moe/ and even KH were allowed to take every night. Its not about Mo being assertive since MO does call for the ball low post, since MO does cut, since Mo does call for lobs, since Mo does move along the perimeter and finds open gaps in his teammates eye's path for an open shot. Mo was just ignored. \n\nMaybe its Mo's fault his teammates sometimes refuse to pass to him. I have noticed also many times that Paolo/Cole go above and beyond to get Mo the ball but it usually takes a bit of time which again maybe thats Mo's fault. Mo has things he needs to work on. But he wasn't the problem. His plus minus, his fg percentage, his defensive field goal percentage, his lineup data, his advanced stats, all support that Mo wasn't the problem. I honestly think he was the solution for many of the losses. However, the team made a choice. They chose Bol's potential (still feel like MO has more but Bol does seem like a super potential player) and flair/media clicks over Mo. They also chose Moe's hustle-like style, high energy and loudmouth offense with a splash of nepotism, over Mo. I can understand it. I personally think they all actually work best together but I would have started Mo. \n\nIt's understandable but I dont blame MO at all. He didn't work out but not because of his fault. Others were prioritized for politics and sadly fans eat that up even if its to the detriment of the team right now. Maybe it works out in the future. Bol and Moe are great prospects and I do like them. I think Mo is straight better than both right now. Mo starts for the Lakers a team that will contend. I am sure Magic fans will credit Lebron for any breakout by Mo and honestly, I would not doubt that having Bron and AD will make Mo get easier and better looks but the potential is the same and the breakout could have happened here as it will happen there. Mo will be a superstar and sadly I was hoping it will happen here but I do believe that he will one day come back to Orlando. I truly enjoyed watching Mo play these many years, his playstyle is fun for me, he is a perma lob threat, he is a good defensive big, and he has times of being a complete monster offensively on the court. Mo has been a great pick to me. I truly think his career is just starting and he will end up being a player talked about for many years. I still see AT great potential. I will continue to watch Mo play on the Lakers (a team I actually dislike) and I will root for him as an individual to win some accolades but I do hope he returns very soon.", "Good luck Mr. Bamba I look forward to seeing you become the player you are capable of being.", "No Bamba No Problems", "Thank you for everything Mo, It was a pleasure getting to know you and seeing you.

Bamba is a special talent and a special person. Perhaps has the highest floor of any player in the draft. Bamba has so much more offensive potential than he was able to show in Shaka Smart's anemic offense. His teammates were unimaginably bad at simple things like post entry passes, and Texas ran an offense that encouraged perimeter players to make plays for themselves and win one-on-one matchups despite having nobody who could do so. Had Bamba played at Kentucky or been featured in a team with a competent coaching staff there wouldn't be nearly as many doubts about his potential. He is absolutely not a project pick, and will have an immediate impact in Orlando. People compre him to Gobert when in reality he's somewhere in between Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis. He will do nothing but get better as time goes on, and his offensive arsenal will eventually leave some of you saying, \"I was so wrong to doubt this pick.\" And for anyone who thinks he's similar to Jarrett Allen- he's not. Jarrett Allen came to and left Texas with 1/5 of Bamba's basketball skill and acumen. As a player you could not have gotten more of a sure thing.\n\nAs a person, the hype is real. People become smitten when they meet this man, and you will too. He will likely be your favorite player by year two. Unbelievable head on his shoulders (considered going to Harvard), extremely humble off the court, very intelligent, and simply as likable a guy as there is in this draft. You all just hit a total home run with this pick. I guarantee you he's a fan favorite in no time. And I assure you that i'm no Texas homer- i would never be talking like this about Myles Turner or Jarrett Allen.

He doesn't have a glaring weakness like Jabari did, in terms of handling, passing, shot creation, etc etc.\n\n I always thought he'd be the best rookie and instant offense. I think his 3pt shot is underrated too. He has a solid jumper. I think he can shoot it better in the NBA than he did in college. He will get a lot of good looks with us and he will be soooo nasty in being on either side of a pick and roll. I'm excited to see how this works out.\n\nIt was a surprising pick to me.

Doesn't sound smart to me.", "It simply makes no sense.\n\nIF he menaged to trade down and get some unprotected pick from Houston and Banchero than that would be \"masterclass\".But whole sharade was about nothing since Magic were on clock first and drafted player that most people expected to be aveliable at 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Never let them know your next move\" only makes sense if you make massive leveradge by not telling, if you never let anybody know your next move...and do something that really isn't all that beneficial for anybody, including you... you are just playing yourself and others are there to see it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like Banchero... and i like him probably more than Jabari..

He has A LOT work to do to fix this roster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso printing Banchero's jersey over Bamba's number pretty much said Bamba is history. and that's Weltman's 6th overall pick being definition of a waste ( and other 6th overall pick, Isaac, is rotting money, and 5th overall pick ,Suggs, doesn't fit Banchero as he can't shoot to save his life, same with Fultz).

Anyways, they're all shooting for the super max extension.", "I really dont think we should pick for fit tbh. We should go for whoever we think can be our star and worry about fit when that happens.

Definitely need to hit the play in with Banchero is RoY", "No but it's representative of where the game has gone offensively.", "Obviously but he shoots a better 3 ball than the guy we picked... in a league where shooting 3s dominates the offense.", "Not sure what makes you think Paolo isn't capable of becoming that type of dominant player. No one knew for certain Giannis would turn out the way he did when he was drafted.\n\nWe have to take chances on generational players. IMO Paolo has that potential.", "Hmmmm I think the Randle comparison is popularized by their size and build and is sort of a lazy comp otherwise. I see some similarity in his post game. He is sort of a Randle/Tatum mix to me.\n\nLook at Randle at 19 on Kentucky. He was like a 1.5 level scorer. Most of his points were dunks, put backs, offensive rebounds where his strength in college got him a bucket. But you could see that even with his strength, and decent footwork he still wasn't getting the best looks at the basket, often finishing away from the rim.\n\nPaolo is a legit 3 level scorer. You never saw Randle take it cost to coast, cross someone up, spin and dunk fluidly. Or, do a crossover step back into a 3. Stuff like that. Randle wasn't really able to shoot 3s at a decent clip until his 6th year in the league. They are much different players, especially if you look at them both in the NCAA.\n\nIf 19 year old rookie Paolo is akin to a 27 year old, one time all-star in Randle, i'd say he is off to a good start, and has plenty of room to grow.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't really call Chet a better shooter. He shot far less threes, most of 'em were when he was trailing and wide open. He also shot worse from the foul line.", "Oh for sure. Just saying I don\u2019t think that was the case this year or we probably would have traded down to 3 if Houston really wanted Smith.

This doesn\u2019t excuse the FO from ultimately drafting a bust, if it comes to that in a few years.", "OKC got a thing or two to learn", "I mean more in how badly I think he could bust. They're not similar in a playstyle way", "Yeah I watched some Thabeet videos and he seemed to genuinely not know how to play basketball. Chet could get injured or fail to become a top offensive player but he is way more athletic and nimble and also knows how to play basketball.", "Makes no sense why we have any attachment to him. What did he ever give us. Like 5 good games?", "Because for the past month it was a forgone conclusion Jabari would go first. Chet would go second. So that's Banchero or Ivey. We, as fans, thinking there was no damn way we could ever get Jabari, started to love Banchero. And don't get me wrong, I liked Banchero. But before the draft order was called, all fans felt like Jabari was 1, Chet 2 and Banchero 3.", "Sorry but Paolo is not a generational player.  There have only been 4 of those in the last 30 years.  The Giannis comparison is also a reach.", "Not just their body types but their play styles.  They score mostly within the perimeter, driving and using their big bodies to create space. Occasionally they'll shoot a 3.  \n\nPaolo is a polished product.  I just don't think it translates to how the game is played today.  Those spin moves and drives he did in college against smaller players won't come so easy in the NBA.  \n\nChet will get the green light to shoot more 3s in OKC.  It will be fun watching all 3 play.

Everyone loses in gambling", "I read the whole post and none of it means anything when he played nearly half of his rookie season. \n\nYeah, he\u2019s not a good shooter, but don\u2019t fluff it up when he didn\u2019t even play 50 games lol.", "You sound like someone who's never placed a bet. It's not even about winning, it just gives you a rooting interest.\n\n\nRegular casino style gambling is lame and does lose money fast, I'm strictly talking about sports betting", "Cool so you take one thing into account and nothing else, which means you\u2019re terrible at objectively viewing the situation. Injuries or not, what he did on the court offensively was trash and that\u2019s reality. \n\nNowhere did I claim he was going to be a bust; I simply said if it pans out that way in a few years then the FO is going to have that mark on their record. The entire point of my post was to say that you can\u2019t evaluate the FO on a single draft pick. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve cleared that up for you, is there any other plain-as-day part of my posts that you want me to cover? Sheesh.", "I feel sorry for you", "Shooting? Terrible, sure. Offensively trash? Again bruh. He\u2019s a rookie adjusting to the NBA and learning the system. He showed flashes of good driving ability and playmaking. Also it is quite convenient you ignore his already good defense. \n\nRegarding our front office though. Even if Jalen turns out being a bust, there\u2019s more to the quality of the front office than just draft picks. They\u2019ve handed out some fairly team friendly contracts, made good trades, as well as done right by the guys on the team.

I don't think Kuminga would've been a useless forward. Ideally Suggs could run the point better than anybody else, including Kelle, Kelle finds his jumpshot he had in college, then he could slide over to his natural position, the 2, and Suggs and Cole split time running point. I'm all for that, but if that's even possible still remains to be seen.", "Are u saying he\u2019s gonna be a great shooter in the nba right away?", "Neither was his free throw %", "Not sure what comparing his stats to the number 1 picks means. Suggs is a good athlete but probably not the athlete Edwards is, and he\u2019s shorter and 20 lbs lighter than Edwards and Cunningham. Certain college stats don\u2019t translate to the NBA cuz physical attributes really matter in the NBA, every pound and inch matters so unless he\u2019s got Russel Westbrook\u2019s athleticism, playmaking, and he could shoot on top of that, there\u2019s still probably a ceiling for his game. Whereas college shooting stats should matter cuz the 3pt line in college is way shorter compared to the nba so if his shooting stats are just ok in college, he\u2019s probably not gonna be a great shooter in the nba right away, it\u2019ll take time.", "I like his defense and playmaking stats, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a better shooter than Cole right now, his shooting %\u2019s in college are not that impressive. If he\u2019s strictly playing the 1 and Cole is playing the 2, he\u2019ll probably have a significant impact. So if it\u2019s mainly Suggs and Fultz at the 1, that means less minutes for Cole at the 1, which limits him cuz I don\u2019t think he\u2019s big enough to play the 2. The ideal type of players for Cole to potentially become is steph curry, dame Lillard type 1s, great offensively with some playmaking skills, not great defensively and not big enough to play the 2.", "He\u2019s a great athlete and floor general but his shooting stats in college were just avg, 3pt% and ft%, ppl in here were saying he\u2019s a better shooter than Cole and some of the other Magic guards, but I doubt that\u2019s gonna be the case in his rookie season, maybe eventually. Hopefully he proves me wrong, but there\u2019s too many guards and wings on the team, was kinda confused by the pick", "I think he played one game when Cole, Randle and Mcw were hurt, but no he never really played 1, he was always at 2", "Wings are also very valuable in today's NBA bro. Lets sort it out, see whos replaceable, and then trade them for positions of need. We will get good returns. Trust me, this is a good problem to have a in a rebuild.", "This athleticism point is more of an issue for Wagner.", "Cole is a better version of DJ Augustine. A limited 6th man who can run your offense in a pinch and shoot. He isnt a starting NBA PG. He will have a great career if he can carve out that energy 6th man role.", "Yeah he didn't play on one of the best passing college offenses in years. Did you not hear the announcers drool over the ball movement the zags do? It's not an iso offense. But sure. Stats bro.", "Suggs is pretty streaky but he can heat up. Most likely scenario is the magic move some of the guards on the roster sometime next season.", "Yea if he could play the 3 that would be ideal, time will tell", "Considering they seem to be shopping Ross and Harris around, solid prospects in place at the 4 and the 5, Suggs is starting to make sense.", "Agreed but the guy above was comparing Suggs to Edwards, their games are pretty different, that\u2019s why I brought up the athleticism factor.", "Haha wow, he\u2019s way more athletic than Augustin, but I still don\u2019t think Suggs could shoot better than him right now, but we\u2019ll see when the time comes. Regardless, the Magic have too many guards/wings, someone\u2019s minutes are gonna get cut.", "How\u2019s Cole looking so far? Suggs should be coming off the bench, his shooting\u2019s horrendous right now.", "Ppl on reddit are so one-track minded, i was not talking about his passing, ppl in here were saying he shoots better than some of the magic guards, thus will take away their minutes but I\u2019m not so sure about that, taking another guard for a guard/wing heavy roster just seemed confusing when Kunminga was still on the board, but we\u2019ll see, I hope I\u2019m wrong. I honestly don\u2019t watch college hoops much cuz a lot of it does not translate to the pros, plus the college system exploits the heck out of these athletes, that being said Suggs seems legit and a hard worker so I hope he proves me wrong and could stretch the floor from day 1, but it\u2019s just more realistic to say it\u2019s gonna take him at least a couple of years to become a consistent NBA shooter. And if the Zags had such a great passing offense, I would think his 3pt % would\u2019ve been higher no?. How many Gonzaga superstars are there in the NBA? He\u2019d have to be the first one and they got spanked by Baylor in the finals, so maybe ease your expectations, no players are perfect, I\u2019m just pointing out his shooting in college wasn\u2019t bad but wasn\u2019t exceptional either.", "His game reminds me of Josh Hart with better playmaking, which is solid, but streaky shooting will not make NBA defenses respect, think it\u2019ll take least a couple years for him to become a consistent shooter.", "Suggs doesn't really look to shoot as much as he should, because he's a pass/drive first guy who will ignore wide open looks as he's focused on creating shots for others. Most of his shooting is done when the rest of the team is having an off day and he has to force his own shots in an effort to spark the team back to life. Suggs thrives at driving and dishing creating open shots for others. He's like Lebron in that regard, because both of them don't shoot as much as they could/should because they're prone to drawing attention and then swinging it to the open man.", "\"I honestly don\u2019t watch college hoops much cuz a lot of it does not translate to the pros,\"\n\n- yep and we have it. Could've saved yourself alot of typing. Just stop dude. You've clearly never watched a Jalen game or probably anyone else and go off mock draft rankings.", "what're you saying? I'm strictly talking about his shooting, not bashing him as a prospect. You don't have to watch college hoops to know whether they're gonna do well in the NBA, 99% of college players don't make the NBA buddy. A lot of skills in college basketball don't translate to the pros cuz physical attributes matter more as millions of dollars are at stake.", "basically you're a Suggs stan and can't fathom any type of mild criticism of his game, and I wasn't even really criticizing Suggs, more the Magic for taking another guard when they already have capable young AND veteran guards that all need playing time, ppl here acting like Suggs is a savior and'll bring the Magic a title or something, get real"], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

Not sure the best way to express this but it\u2019s an extremely popular sport among the working-class, with a similar sort of fanbase to the NFL in the USA. The general NZ public, i.e. white neighbourhood mums, are extremely fickle and support rugby because NZ wins literally everything.\n\nThere\u2019s a definite shift in the youth towards football (soccer) which is by far the most played youth sport. Basketball\u2019s growing extremely quickly too.\n\nTo answer your other question, it\u2019s tough to say but I think I\u2019d have it around 5 or 6 - rugby, cricket, football are all definitely more popular and other sports like rugby league and netball could be above it too. Almost everyone here\u2019s an OKC fan, we\u2019ve had New Zealanders in the NBA before but Adams grew the game here an insane amount on his own.

It's super esoteric here. There's lots of fans/players, I'm sure, but I only know a handful.\n\nI also had no idea the impact of Steven and RJ. That's really cool to hear. I wonder why RJ chose NZ over Europe or Australia?", "I ordered it with the pre-orders so I knew it wasn't actually available for shipping until the end of February but I'm sure COVID probably delayed that a little because it didn't even get any shipping information until mid-March. Missed the delivery for it on Thursday because I was working and then couldn't pick it up because of Easter. Glad to finally have my hands on it!", "I almost certainly haven't lived here long enough to give an accurate answer for that but your guess is probably pretty accurate, with basketball possibly even higher. Different parts of the country probably prefer different things but there's certainly basketball hoops everywhere which you definitely don't get back in the UK. It probably does help that timezones mean we can watch the NBA live over here, whereas it's much harder to watch live football (soccer).", "Ooh yeah, it\u2019s definitely a niche sport in the US. I can\u2019t tell you how much it meant to me when [60,000+ sold out Soldier Field in Chicago to watch NZ play you guys back in 2014](https://youtu.be/_wzDjUFmtm0). It\u2019s definitely on the up as a sport in places it previously wasn\u2019t - still gives a \u2018hipster\u2019 impression to many in the States I\u2019m sure, but the introduction of a professional US rugby league is a great sign.\n\nYour kind words about your country mean a lot.

I'm a super skinny guy, so I was always better suited for football (soccer), but I'm happy to hear that rugby is growing in popularity.

Stuff like that, it is not helping Fultz so why are they doing it?  Theyre being selfish and reactionary in a situation that needs patience which the Sixers bent over backwards to provide.  Even the fans were patient, anything he did was great because he was our underdog even if he was a #1 pick.  We kept the Foles chant that we took from the Vikings SKOL chant and turned it into a Fultz chant, it was a ton of fun at the arena.  \n\nThere was a \"Fultz trade request\" for a couple of days but then after that he is on the bench chumming it up with the guys having a great time during the game.

Mixed signals left and right\n\nThe Sixers were in a position they could not possibly win.  If he says he is injured you can't play him.  Now Fultz says something about not being pushed hard enough which i do believe he is being passive aggressive at the Sixers and im not sure why.  If others dont that is fine but its an odd thing to say if he had no ill intent.

He only returned late in the season because he walked into Brown's office before a game and said he was ready to play. \n\nThis year despite the hitch, he said he was healthy the entire time until his agent announced he wasn't.

He was a cunt and no one in Philly ever liked him. But Fultz directly attacked the coaches and that's just silly. Coaches were nothing but supportive of him.

Please, I dare you.\n\nI won't blame the FO for gambling and trading for VC but the trade for Arenas, and trading back for Hedo were such head-scratching moves along with the poor management over the SVG issue just made Dwight's choice of leaving so much easier...\n\nI'm not trying to say Dwight had no fault in this but the FO is and will always be at fault for losing not 1, but 2 HOF big men in franchise history.", "And honestly, if we take a step back on the SVG v. Dwight issue... let's break this down because I never understood why Dwight always gets the blame here.  \n\n\nFirst of all, it certainly would not be the first time for a star player to ask management to fire the head coach in the NBA. LeBron has done a fair share of this earlier in his career and during his second sting in CLE (D.Blaine), I don't see him getting flamed for being the 'coach killer'. And don't use the argument about LeBron being an All-time great and he can do that because when that incident took place, Dwight was arguably neck-and-neck with LeBron in terms of clout and both players haven't won a ring.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond of all, it was NEVER confirmed that Dwight asked for the firing and even if he did, why in the world would management tell this to Stan?? This is obviously a behind the door request if Dwight did want Stan fired but should've never been communicated to Stan for obvious reasons. So obviously the Magic FO is dysfunctional and untrustworthy.   \n\n\nAnd then... Stan goes in front of the MEDIA and confirms the rumor knowingly what kind of drift this will create between the Team/organization and Dwight.  The FO should've fired him on the spot to protect Dwight but nope.... It really tells you the character of Stan and the office.   \n\n\nDecide for yourself who is really at fault here if you were in Dwight's shoes.", "That\u2019s a lot of crying and complaining to get all the way to a NBA championship.. still not as much crying and complaining as you do", "Butler is in Miami because of the organization.

We got Ibaka in order to mask the deficiencies of Payton and Vucevic and then signed Biyombo to shore up the big rotation. If you look at Vogel's past teams you can see a pattern. Indiana kept a very big team with the same type of rotation and those Indy teams also relied on a defensive anchor in the middle, which was supposed to be Biyombo. It fits Vogel to a tee", "Every sports fan base do this to an ex-player when they left on terrible terms.

It\u2019s absolutely a gamble and there is not guarantee it will work out, but it\u2019s worth the risk because we were never going to win a championship with those 3 (which is the goal). \n\nOur roster has a great amount of talent given how young they are. I feel like we have a good shot at having a bunch of good players on our roster. The real question is whether we can keep them all and not lose them to free agency.", "Addition by subtraction. Now that the trash got taken out we have a chance to do real things next season.", "Ok, I do see your point with the 1st paragraph. We definitely were not going to win a championship with our former team. The problem is, in starting this rebuild, we could have at least gotten a good combination of young players in return for Vuc and Gordon.   \n\nWe did get Wendell Carter Jr, but other than that we got 2 role players who are no upgrade over what we had before.   \n\nI would say our roster has a bit of talent.

So someone of that caliber basically shitting on orlando, of course we fans would get defensive and take those words personally.\n\nYeah he wont ever get traded here, i wouldnt want him here.

Going over to the Hornets they just lost their leading scorer, Melo is great, Rozier is v nice then you got Hayward who can't stay healthy, Bouknight who's still an unknown from my understanding, PJ Washington who's been so so, Oubre who is solid but not a game changer, I think they might lost Harrell for a bit on drug charges and a whole lack of direction for the team and who they are. We don't have a gamechanger like Melo but Paolo has that potential and Kelle brings a lot with his playmaking to make other players better.

Like last year in the bubble coming off missing time for covid against the best defense in the league. And last year against the eventual nba champs in his first ever playoff series. 10 games total and playing in a role bigger than the one he actually belongs in. I still think he will be a good playoff performer if he can play off a legit superstar. \n\nIt\u2019s always gonna be tough for both he and Vuc when they are the primary guys being gameplanned for.

You\u2019ve said it yourself over and over and I see people saying it all the time. Evan and Vuc being our best players means we\u2019re mediocre. Because they themselves are not top 10 guys. So you hate them with the passion of a thousand suns because they don\u2019t drop 25 a night and lead us to championships.\n\nThe only other logic I\u2019ve seen for despising Evan is people having a delusional belief that Markelle or JI are secretly hyper efficiency 25 ppg guys, but they can\u2019t reach their potential cause Evan steals all the shots.", "No you're at the delusional one, and stop putting words in my mouth no one says none of the crap you're talking about. no one ever thought the magic would be a three seed, but the bottom line dude doesn't show up against the tough teams. We're definitely good enough to beat some of those teams especially because a lot of those games were close. But if we just had an efficient game from our lead scores we definitely wouldn't have been an eighth seed cuz we're so much better than that. And either way you're just proving my point, who wants a lead score who folds against competition.

Why do I have to go through all of that just for you when you can do it yourself", "It\u2019s based on performance my friend. All you bring is fake straw men arguments to those who criticize the chronic underperforming of Fournier. One game doesn\u2019t change it.", "Because you\u2019re the one making the unfounded claim that the reason we don\u2019t beat above .500 teams is in fact not because those teams are simply more talented, but because Evan Fournier can\u2019t play against them. Since you are making the claim, it is on you to provide something that shows you\u2019re not just spouting made up BS. I think that\u2019s the issue you\u2019ve run into when trying to find supporting evidence: your claim simply isn\u2019t true.", "Lmao are you even a magic fan? Do you even watch the games? so what if a team is more talented than us that doesn't mean we automatically have to lose, they're all professionals and there have been games where we've beaten better teams. Clearly if you watch the game, and most magic fans can tell you Evan Fournier, not even just him all of our stars do not show up in big time moments. If you think that's made up then idk what to tell you \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0fand I'm not about to go copy and paste every game we played just to prove my point when you can easily go and look yourself. The evidence is there to support everything I'm saying you just have to take the extra mile and go look for yourself instead of trying to argue with me. I don't even know what your point is are you saying that Evan Fournier is perfect and there's nothing wrong with him?? You think all the hate he gets is not warranted? like have you been watching the magic for the last 5 years??", "And I'm not saying he's a terrible player, not by any stretch of the imagination. But to act like there's no issues with his game is just ridiculous. I love Evan, and I appreciate everything he's done for us cuz just like the Miami game there's been games where he's the only one who can do something, but there are multiple times where he just doesn't lead the team the way he should.", "> Clearly if you watch the game, and most magic fans can tell you Evan Fournier, not even just him all of our stars do not show up in big time moments.\n\nYes, most magic fans on this forum where Evan Fournier is public enemy number 1 will tell you that he\u2019s garbage 4 quarters and even worse in the clutch. However, in reality Evan is very good in the clutch, especially for a non superstar being asked to perform superstar duties. https://www.nba.com/magic/news/fournier-currently-best-nba-specific-clutch-category-20190303\n\n> I don't even know what your point is are you saying that Evan Fournier is perfect and there's nothing wrong with him?? You think all the hate he gets is not warranted? like have you been watching the magic for the last 5 years??\n\nMy point is the hate is unwarranted. And that because the magic lack a true superstar, the fans here apply superstar standards to Evan and Vuc, and hate them for not meeting the standards. Like you for example have stated that Evan is okay, but he deserves being the most hated person on this sub because he doesn\u2019t consistently perform at the amazing level he did last night, and isn\u2019t a good clutch player (which I provided evidence against in this comment), and that he sucks against good teams (which is also just wrong. You can\u2019t average 19 on great efficiency if you suck against half the league. It\u2019s actually impossible unless you think he averages 28 on 80 TS against bad teams and 11 on 40 TS against good team)\n\nSo you\u2019re criteria for him to not be shit on is for him to consistently put up 23+ on great efficiency, do it also against elite teams, while also balling in the clutch. That description is of a superstar on this league and perfectly illustrates why warped expectations of Evan are the source of all the unnecessary hate he receives on social media.", "Okay dude whatever you win. Evan is an excellent player He's so clutch and not inconsistent at all, and he rises above and beyond against tougher teams. He deserves no hate, and we should sign him again until he retires. Is that better for you?", "Again you\u2019ve completely missed the point. I\u2019m not saying Evan is perfect. I\u2019m saying that expecting Evan to be perfect and then shitting on him for not is dumb. And that\u2019s what this sub does. The reality is a good player and starting 2, but not a star. He\u2019s not the source of all our problems, and he\u2019s not the solution for all our problems. He\u2019s just a good auxiliary piece that people on social media despise and attack for not being more than that and I find it ridiculous.", "And I literally stated some of the hate he doesn't deserve, but some of it he definitely does. And Rather he's a Superstar or not He's still a professional player, and if he can have those superstar standards against the sorry teams I think we can hold him to Superstar standards against tougher teams. But I'm done going back and forth with someone who doesn't even try to look at other angles. At the end of the day I'm a magic fan and I hope you're right about Fournier because rather anyone likes it or not he's our most clutch and efficient score and I just need him to be that. I could care less about wins or losses, or number sI just need to see Evan be consistent no matter who the opponent is. And with that you have a good day.", "I totally get your point, and I did mention that I don't think he's a bad player at all, I actually like Evan Fournier. But being a magic fan for so long and literally watch every game there's just times where he doesn't show up rather that's being our superstar or just being a contributing piece to a win. I definitely get what you're saying about this sub, well any magic content creator they hate on Fournier. Last year I had to defend him so many times, but they're definitely is times where it is warranted is all I'm saying. I get he's not going to be James harden every night, but we don't need him to be James harden in the playoffs more nights than he's actually effective."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

I feel like MCW on Beal a lot more could\u2019ve slowed him down (a few games ago).

The team squeaked by as the thunder self destructed in the last 4 minutes. The Thunder had some very sloppy plays throughout the game that the Magic (starters especially) failed to capitalize on. \n\nThe defensive rotations have been especially troublesome. When the defense is scrambled, players struggle to find the right assignments and end up leaving someone open. A better opponent would make the Magic pay for these mistakes. \n\nToo many guards are giving up on switches and picks on the wings and expecting Vucevic to clean it up. That won't work against skilled scoring teams. \n\n\nThe Sixers are next and if they have a bad game, the team may lucky enough to squeak by with another win. But the Sixers are a large, interior-focused team that can make things difficult for the Magic. The starters need to rise to the occasion.\n\nTonight, Dwayne Bacon made all the right plays at the right moments. \n\nI continue to be impressed with the bench. They play with pride and alacrity.\n\nCole Anthony is not shy at all and Okeke is finding his confidence. I love how Clifford isn't afraid to put them in for long stretches and allow them to develop.

We give the rookie forward more touches over TRoss, AG or the point guard? \n\nI think he's slowly getting it from the defensive end. He's making deflections, granted the shot isn't there yet but maybe sooner than later defenses will sag off him more, daring him to shoot. \n\nI think he's more of a 3 than a 4, which is promising tbh.\n\nEdit: I remember reading something about ACL injury recoveries, that while most players can return after a year, it's really after 2 years that they fully return to how they were pre-injury.", "I disagree. While he does look a bit slow, it\u2019s all because of the injury and lack of professional play. The game at each level (high school, college, pro) moves progressively faster, more so than we realize. He\u2019s going to need a lot of time to adjust considering his last consistent play was in March 2019 and it wasn\u2019t at the professional level. \n\nFor me, he gets a pass until next season.

I would be very interested in seeing what Bamba can do in his role.", "He looks like a rookie who hasn't played much in 20 months. Hes making improvements every game though, and thats what I'm looking for. This was probably his best all around game to date, and the box score showed that.

Sure, they are making mistakes, but that effort, especially on the defense end, earns them time to make mistakes on the floor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith Chuma, in particular, he needs to figure out the defensive rotations better. He needs to dive deep into the scouting report and know that you never leave Mike Miscala or Davis Bertans open at the three point line. That you don't need to help on a driving Ish Smith because he'll probably miss the layup. Thats the kind of stuff that he has to work on.

He looks good", "Exactly.  It's been a lose lose with some fans since they have taken over.  Same people that want us to both win now **and** tank for the future.  Like I said, I'm not sure what some people are expecting out of them.  Weve been an awful team with awful management for so long, it drives me crazy to see negativity when we are finally getting back on track.  \n\nAre we a favorite to win a title?  No.  But at least we are competitive and getting better. Be happy with what we got friends.", "This happens after every draft.

Will quiet people and take the pressure off when he finally makes his debut.", "That's what I meant, I was pointing out that the plan was projected far in advance and JJ was made aware of it.\n\nEither way, I think it's unfair to make all these assumptions. There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding MF, and there isn't much at all that IS certain. All that's certain is we don't know a whole lot about the situation, and that's fair because the dudes personal life is none of our business.

When they left their perspective jobs, the foundation and goals were pretty clear", "Who? Okeke or Markelle", "I don\u2019t think they have the best odds to win (or even second best odds). But if they do, It will be because they have a top-5 player in James harden surrounded by good shooters. \n\nBringing Westbrook to Orlando wouldn\u2019t bring us to the finals, let alone winning everything.  Westbrook had PG 13. Before that, he had Durant and Harden. They never won a championship.", "I thought he would be a HORRIBLE fit next to simmons. They should have drafted Tatum, the most logical choice", "It was not a good fit and rather dumb in my opinion", "to save face from wanting out of that terrible situation", "Cap space, tax, it's still for money.", "Okeke", "I get that it's really easy to say that they should've never traded up and grabbed Tatum with the 3rd pick instead, but before the draft Kelle was far and away the best prospect and the consensus #1 pick. It was the most logical choice at the time, but hey, hindsight os 20/20.\n\nPersonally I thought we would end up with Josh Jackson or trade back a couple of spots and get Malik Monk, either way I think it worked out for the best for both teams.

Not only should we be patient and give him a chance, but we shouldn\u2019t waste time trying to string together a title winning team with the pieces we have. Even if he doesn\u2019t pan out, we\u2019re setup with stability for the next 5 years.", "l\no\nl\n\nHe's been trying to push this sorry ass meme everywhere and failing spectacularly.", "I love the positivity. And we were hot before the break. But this team will never be full potential without JI. That\u2019s why this is so sad. We all know how special he is. That #1 is special. Usually the curse hits them after they leave us, but man JI got the knee injury here and it hurts. We have to pray he comes back two seasons from now and can catch back up. But honestly the hope of the franchise for the next 3-6 years is on Markelle. And hopefully we can find him another number 2. And JI will be a bonus if he comes back healthy. Overall fuck injuries, fuck haters on twitter, and we all love JI", "Thank you. Someone talking some sense in this sub.", "I tore mine too in high school.  I came back and was felt more athletic than ever and went on to play 4 years in college with no further issues from that knee. You can 100% come back from an ACL now a days and a lot of times people are stronger than before.  Look a Russell Westbrook and Baron Davis as good examples of that.\n\nI will say that it did take a while to recover to where I was better than before. I don\u2019t mean in rehab but once you get back to the court. I would say that it took 6 months of playing after being cleared to have that full strength back.\n\nMost of my issues now come from the bone fracture and cartilage tear that happened with the ACL.  If JI only tore his ACL and didn\u2019t damage anything else, his recovery could be even faster.", "I\u2019m willing to wager the \u201cre-tear\u201d rate is directly related to the quality of the surgeon and the rehab. That being said, I am dubious of Orlando\u2019s medical staff and hope JI and his agent seek out the absolute best", "I imagine if he retears it he would have serious thoughts of retiring sadly lol \n\nYou doing ok now?", "Hard to respect the logic of someone talking about curses. If you are being serious you know winning a title in the next two years isn\u2019t going to happen with or without JI, barring some spectacular improvement by multiple players. JI is going to be fine and will be back in 18 months. ACLs are not career ending injuries anymore. He just needs a good surgeon and doctor and time to heal properly.\n\nEDIT: typos", "What the fuck are you guys smoking?", "There was has been 105 acl tears since 1970 and only 9 have reinjured. \n\nYou could still be right, but the chance of a reinjury seems low", "I think it\u2019s called, basketball-is-a-team-sport-juana. You know, the reason there are other players on the floor and even more on the bench ready to come in and play.", "The part where JI isn't leading our stats in anything. He will be missed but our boys will be fine.", "Yeah. It\u2019s a mistake to lump Hs and college acl repairs into the equation with professional athletes who typically get the best of the best.", "Have you seen our roster mate? Are we winning a few games with these guys? Sure. Are we winning a series with these guys? Fuck no. Not a snowballs chance in hell", "Except for steals and blocks. Also the team gives up less ppg when he\u2019s on the court. His presence definitely gives us a better chance.", "Lol! Oh I see, you think we were with out a doubt going to win at least one series because JI?", "We had more of a chance than finding a snowball in hell, yes.", "Listen to yourself man: you are bemoaning the loss of a player that in your own word merely \u201cincreased our chances of winning 1 - ONE series\u201d as if we just lost MJ in his prime! This is exactly my point. This is an 8th seed team with or without JI. They aren\u2019t going to make a title run because JI is there or not make one because he isn\u2019t.", "Ahem 7th seed team.  But I get your point.  Fans here are too optimistic on our young guys its why they haven't given up on Bamba who isn't good.  Isaac is awesome on defense and was showing improvements on offense but he was never gonna be that guy as currently constructed.", "7th, right now. Wait a week. Personally I think JI has the highest ceiling of all our players, even with the injury. However, I don\u2019t think at this point in his career he is the difference between a first round knock out and a long playoff run.", "No way we get passed by.  Isaac has a real high ceiling for our team but I still think Gordon's skillset supercedes anything JI can do.", "That\u2019s where you and I part ways. I like Gordon, I just don\u2019t think Gordon is quite quick enough to pull off what he is best at, and players don\u2019t usually get quicker. But, if he becomes more consistent outside, of change my mind real quick. Right now I\u2019d rather have Tobias Harris back than Gordon, but that\u2019s just me. I see why people like Gordon.", "My my, look whose 8th"], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

They aren\u2019t us, happy with a first round sweep every year with a losing record limp dicking into the playoffs.\n\nAnd the Fournier contract isn\u2019t bad in the context of their team.

He plays within his game and didn't force any shots.", "#FreeJudah", "My wife asked me what jersey I wanted before the game started tonight, and I told her JI.", "I think JI and AG should switch roles on offense, AG is much better off ball and JI is much better on ball.

Well him and Fultz", "Some of you really need to slow down saying we need make trades to make Isaac the number 1 option on offense. I love JI but he\u2019s never gonna be a teams best scorer. If he can be a reliable 2nd or 3rd option on a playoff team while continuing to play great defence, then you\u2019ve got yourself an exceptionally good player. For a team like us that is near the bottom of the league in offense, trading away our best offensive players to give the team to JI sounds foolish. Just let him ease into that 3rd scoring option role that he\u2019s becoming.", "Yeah I think it\u2019s clear he\u2019s our cornerstone", "Going to? I'd say tonight he pretty much did that and demanded he get the ball more. That was with very little plays designed for him. It was all in the flow of the game. We start gameplanning for him and watch out...", "... it was one game.\n\nJI was great, but to think that we should \"make him the focal point on offense\" is ridiculous at this point. Part of the reason he did so well is precisely because Evan had such a great game, he was getting doubled most trips on offense because the Pacers weren't really worried about guys like Isaac hurting them.\n\nOnce Vooch is back hopefulyl Isaac can keep building off performances like this and maybe then we will have a competent overall offense.", "Yeah I've been saying this since the season began, AG just isn't a small forward, and shouldn't be bringing the ball up the court so often and forcing pull up jumpers. It's when he plays more of a Draymond Green type of role on offense that he really excels.\n\nThis team is capable of being a top team in the East, it just needs to make some minor changes in the way they play. Coach needs to stop centering the offense around Fournier and Vuc and start drawing things up for Isaac. Isaac is the budding superstar that we've been waiting for all these years imo, but if we never get him the ball then we'll never realize it.", "Rather trade AG", "Now I agree we don't need to trade everyone. Not trying to put words in your mouth, but if after tonight you don't think he came be the possible #1 option on a team when he's playing like this at 21 and seems to be demanding the ball is letting our boy down. He is hungry and ready to eat. He has shown great poise on the offensive end and his stroke is looking gorgeous. I'm not saying it's a sure thing, but I almost bet you he could become an all star for this team.", "One game doesn't make a break out, in my opinion. He has four more weeks to carry the load. How he handles being \"The Man\" and having more plays specifically for him, will determine how much of a break out he has.", "If JI keeps playing like this in his absence, I don't see a reason to not trade both lol\n\nWe've gone through the \"watch the late 20's players be the focus of the offense while the younger players stand in the corner and watch\" days literally since Dwight left. As much as I want to win now, I've always wanted a proper rebuild. Turning our focus towards an emerging JI and Markelle would be awesome, assuming JI keeps this kind of performance throughout.", "I love AG but I'm starting to wonder if we should do this lol. It just feels like JI has quickly developed into the player that I've always wanted to see AG become. Also when Okeke joins the team next year, there's probably going to be an odd man out if Okeke is as good as I'm hoping.", "Exactly! Example: Pascal Siakam", "First of all I love JI and the amount of times I've come to his defence in arguments against some ignorant fans of other teams is insane. I agree that he's coming along nicely and a few more drawn plays for him would help his progression but to try and force him to become the star of the team isn't a good move. It's not his game to constantly give him the ball in the half court and ask him to give us a bucket like similar framed guys like Kevin Durant. If we were to ask him to play like a KD type player he's going to be very uncomfortable and shoot poorly, not saying he can't grow to become a better half court scorer but I can guarantee you he will never be Kevin Durant or even a 26ppg scorer like Ingram (i'm strictly speaking offense here, he's already much better than both on defense). To say he can become that KD like scorer is saying hes probably going to be the most talented player to ever play the game considering how exceptionally great he already is on defense. \n\nHowever like you said, he has a lot of poise and hustle on offense. He runs well in transition and draws focus away from the ball handler to either make it easier for someone else to score in transition or catching a pass and having a crafty finish at the rim.  His ability to get himself involved in plays without the ball immediately being put in his hands is great and to put up 25 points tonight like he did with minimal plays drawn for him is impressive. That's his main strength and that's how he should be utilised, with more and more plays drawn for him over time as he gets better. By making him the number 1 option you are actually taking away from what he does best on offense. For example/comparison, its partly the reason why a guy as good as Klay Thompson has never had his own team because his strength on offense comes from not being the number 1 option (moving without the ball and being one of the best at reading what the others are doing on offense and putting himself in the best position to score). \n\nJI can potentially be as good as a guy like Klay and I think he is a shot at being a future all star. Like I said, being the 2nd/3rd option on a playoff team while playing exceptional DPOY level defense is not an insult to him at all, that's a tremendous player. But its for the best interest for him and for the team for him to not be the #1 option. But hey as a magic fan unless you say fournier sucks then you must be saying something wrong.", "I agree. I was only making an observation. He feels like he had a different attitude completely. He was aggressive, pulled moves I've never seen, and even acted a little more cold. In the fact that he looked like he wanted to be the guy. He's always been too passive. I didn't feel that way today. He WANTED the ball.", "Honestly...Isaac seems a lot like Spicy P to me. He hung his hat on hustle and defense before his MIP year. Then things clicked and this year he's got his chance to shine and taken it. I think Isaac could have the same or similar path, but a way better defender.", "Durant is basically the #1 of number one options. Nobody is saying JI has to be used like that, but JI is most definitely more gifted offensively than this team allows him to be. You simply cannot say at this point in time though that he can't be a #1 option. It's still too soon and he's shown too much ability. For me, I think it's JI needing to develop that killer instinct offensively, that's what holds him back imo. He showed some of that tonight, when he dribbled the ball back, stared Myles Turner in the eyes and popped the 3 in his face.", "Oh I agree. He by no means needs to try to be that option now. He's not ready. He should be the number 2 with Vooch and AG gone tho. I'm not saying he's a sure thing or that it's even the best path for him to take. But after tonight. I'm convinced he could be a #1 option. Especially with a team as deprived of scoring as this one.\n\nKlay seems like a great example. I think if he can reach that level, he will reach his full potential. But I think even Klay could have his own team. Lol.", "I was getting mad when Augustin wasn't passing him the ball. Thankfully he got taken out afterwards", "Agreed", "JI was getting mad too. You could tell."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

Wanted to give you a brief summary of fultz and hopefully you can give us a quick rundown of Simmons?

From the limited stuff I have seen due to his availability, he get get himself open effortlessly whether it is off the ball or 1 on 1 getting to the basket. He also has more vision than he gets credit for... I think although he needs more experience with it, his passing game is vastly under rated. In terms of defense, he is great. Although a liability, he is great at blocking shots for his size and at the PG position. Although I think he needs a little more defense awareness, he comes up with some great steals.\n\nWhat you all have been waiting for... in terms of off court, he was a huge confusion and headache... due to his potential, we just kinda waited and supported him as fans.

If we have a hurt player, you are damn sure they won't play. If the players can't understand that, I get it, but it's not exactly hard to understand.\n\nI for one am having a great time watching the team.

Most of the fan base was bitching for us to blow it up, tank and rebuild a few years ago when we were making the playoffs. Now we are a year into a proper tank, and a rebuild that is going well, with actual potential stars and you bitch about that.\n\nDo you people realize our team would be meh if we were healthy, and that we are not a market that can attract a free agent that will help us improve anytime soon. We need to grow organically and have more chances at top tier talent. And that's going to take a bit.\n\nI truly believe if we tried to compete right now we'd set ourselves up for meh mid round picks for years, we'd be forced to re-sign players that don't really fit with us, because we can't land a better name in the open market, and we'd only have mediocre mid-round picks and mediocre role players to offer other teams.\n\nWe need another year or so of accumulating the best talent possible in my opinion. It ain't pretty, but smaller market teams just don't break through in the NBA without a generational talent, or a couple of all stars. We are developing our two most probably all-stars in Franz and Paolo well. We need better pieces around them.\n\nEdit: tldr is i'd prob do the same shit.

They don't want to be set up to fail, and I think it's really starting to affect the morale of the team. It's one thing to be cautious, it's another thing entirely to purposely set up guys to lose.

I think the team can be a lottery team if they all played, but this might be a once in a lifetime opportunity for this team to actually build something insane if they land a top draft pick again this year. It takes some big risks for small market teams to compete in the NBA, IMO tanking this year is worth the risk for a possible huge payout.", "These players are working for their second contract. This team holding out players longer than they're supposed to is seriously hurting their value.

On Twitter I had a guy ranting whoever buys the team will move them to Vegas so he never wants the DeVos\u2019 to sell. Come to think of it maybe it was a DeVos burner account.

I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s them or someone else. I\u2019m just hoping someone who has the money who sees the value in the organization and city buys the team eventually. Great ownership can change the trajectory of your team. \n\nOne great example is the Philadelphia Eagles. They were pretty mediocre for decades, Jeffrey Lurie bought that team and they\u2019ve been playoff relevant for 20 years. \n\nWhen was the last time you thought the Mavs were a punching bag? Probably never during Cuban\u2019s reign. \n\nThe point is: owners that care about winning tend to at least put a good product out most seasons.

We would still be having a lot of growing pains and losing close games because we are a young team that's trying to build chemistry under a coach that's learning on the job. A lot of other teams have injured players too.\n\nYou also can't assume that when players return, we will just magically be better somehow. Or if they were in those close games, we would have won. We don't know that. I honestly think we are playing pretty well with Franz and Paolo as the most ball dominant players. I am not sure things will get better when we switch back to a traditional two guard line up, which is what I am assuming will happen when the roster is more healthy.\n\nI love the passion i'm seeing from the fanbase this year, but I think there are a lot of cases where people inflate our players, because they are OUR players and we love 'em.

Just read it again lol. I didn't say it IS that. I said it could easily become that if we try to compete right now. We will hit a road block, we won't be able to afford everyone, and we won't have high draft picks our assets to offer in trades. Right now we are pretty much loading up to ensure a better shot at sustained playoff appearances.

We know being in the NBA doesn't mean your knowledge or skill playing basketball translates to other areas relevant to that example being Dumars. Ross is speculating like anyone else on this sub, it's not wrong to value his opinion I just don't think it should be taken as proof when he's speculating and we've seen his line of thinking on speculation with other topics.", "Still missing that I was never comparing the current team to those players. Just the sort of mediocrity we will be stuck in if we compete too quickly and no longer have assets to aid in building around our stars lol", "There\u2019s no way you think a player in the organization, that communicates with every player and staff member, is just speculating and guessing on what is going on. He knows exactly what is happening in the organization", "it's not crazy to think that but I feel like that's more common than you think. Just stepping back and saying \"what's more likely? the FO is faking injuries or they're being cautious with injury prone players before we get to a point where we're supposed to be competitive?\" I think the answer is clear but the sub seems to think the opposite is the consensus even though it doesn't benefit the team or them in any way", "T Ross never said anything about faking injuries.

His poor shooting numbers have been widely discussed and are the first thing brought up when it comes to his weakness. So, yes, when one considers that he shot 75% from the free throw line at UNC and then his shooting form has several oddities in it, one could put 2 and 2 together and project that he will not be a lights out shooter in the NBA with that form.\n\nTyler Herro's 3 point shooting numbers at Kentucky were unimpressive but the Heat knew he'd be a good shooter because of his form and his 90+ FT rate.\n\nMy prediction is from the gestalt of Cole Anthony not this single video", "Victor didn't start right away he was on the bench until about 20 games in, and I believe he went back and forth throughout the season from starter to bench. Also he was railroaded because he was our top 5 pick who was playing behind an aging Aaron Afflalo who was never going to be a star. Once again the Magic prioritizing mediocre vets over young potential stars (or atleast young lottery picks). I repeat, This is also why MCW won rookie of the year that season.\n\n\nElfrid started because the only other PG we had on the roster was (an aging) Luke friggin Ridneour, and at the time to Magic thought he had star potential. The truth is he wasn't very good at all, one of the worst players in the NBA. Another example of poor talent evaluation by the Magic.\n\n\nAG and Tobias play 2 different positions (or atleast should have been) and they were dumb to try to play AG at SF. It did help his ball handling but ultimately he was playing out of position, slowing down his development, and stunting his growth as an NBA player. So they did not develop AG properly either.\n\n\nAlso Tobias Harris wasn't very good IMO a mediocre player who was a Gary stu type. Average to below average at everything, master of nothing, and also not very athletic at all. Great character but average player (at best) at the end of the day. There was nothing special about his game at all.\n\n\nMario was never really given a fair chance until he left Orlando. Maybe he was garbage in all reality but the Magic didn't do him any favors, they handled his development very poorly (as usual). It also could've been another example of poor talent evaluation by the Magic (typical).\n\n\nAnd Lastly Bamba, he was given the absolute worst railroading of any of them. Why draft a center in the top 10, and then hand Vooch a 100 million dollar contract right after, makes no sense. How do you expect him to develop? We don't even know if Bamba can play or not because he hasn't even been given a fair chance to develop (typical). Ideally Bamba would outwork Vooch and earn his spot in the starting line up, but come on he's a rookie going to a team who has a love affair with a guy that plays the same position as him. What chance did he really have to develop into a star? Once again the Magic prioritizing mediocre veterans over young potential stars (or atleast young developmental lottery picks).\n\n\nThe Orlando Magic have one of the poorest talent evaluation and player developmental departments in the entire NBA and it's been that way for a long time. I don't believe any of the guys playing ahead of them were \"dramatically better\". I think they handled all of those situations about as bad as you could and it shows today because we haven't made much progress at all.", "That and their old songs like Ransom.

Thats basically how Dwights team ascended to the top of the east. They didn't just go from lottery to the NBA finals in one year.\n\nThe delusion here is you thinking that it would be better for the development of those young players to just lose every ounce of veteran leadership on this team. That's how you become the Hawks or Hornets or Timberwolves and are a lottery mainstay for decades. I'm not saying the Magic should hold onto the whole damn aging core. One of Fournier and Ross need to go. MCW should go. Aminu should go. Birch should go. AG should go. All there minutes need to be going to Fultz, Cole, the future lottery pick, Chuma, JI and Bamba, be it as starters or backups. But not all of them need to go right NOW and definitely the one that should not be traded is the all star center on a team friendly deal that works well with those young players and most importantly WANTS to be here.\n\nDrop the victim complex, you're not being downvoted because people think you are a fake fan, you're being downvoted because people think your take isn't a good one.", "Evan has played in all 7 of our last 7 games pre all-star break (and played damn well during them) and we went 3-4 with the only wins coming from a bad Detroit team and two mediocre teams in Golden State and the Knicks.

There is barely one or two gimmes for the rest of the season. It's the second hardest schedule in the league left.

If I've said it once I've said it a thousand times - fuck those goddamn Nike puppets\n\n> A lot of people have forgotten how dominant Dwight was,\u201d said Van Gundy. \u201cHe was All-NBA five straight years.

It's a shame the only thing people remember him for now is the failed PE test thanks to LeBron's PR hit squad.  Well, that and the whole Turkish politics thing...\n\n> \u201cOur theory defensively, we wanted him to be more of a scorer and less of a guy to help those guys play well. Those other guys needed Lebron to play well. He put up absolutely huge numbers, but we had more overall talent.\u201d\n\nExactly.

A 23 year old usually bets on getting better and thus, worth more money. The fact that he will be in his prime getting 16 mil is crazy to me.", "I too think the Raptors will struggle to make the playoffs. I also think that the Raptors GM Masai Ujiri will have his finger on the \"Blow It Up\" trade button. If the Raptors are around 8 seed or below January 2020... Its not out of the realm of possibility that he may trade away and build around Siakam. Just look at these trade chips that are in the final year of their deals.\n\nKyle Lowry $33 Million\nMarc Gasol $25.5 Million\nSerge Ibaka $23.2 Million\nFred VanVleet $9.3 Million\n\nAll four player become Unrestricted Free Agents after next season.  Could be a few teams out their DESPERATE and willing to make an amazing offer to a Raptors team looking for a quick rebuild for 2020-2021 Season after.", "Indeed the total is low but, all things being equal, declining makes sense because more of your money is received upfront. Time value of money and all that.", "Definitely agree. I think if on the bubble, they probably ship Lowry first off. A team with Lowry and Siakim as the best players just doesn't seem like a playoff team. Especially losing depth in Green. They will blow it up almost certainly. \n\nSide note, if we are competing and Lowry is up for grabs, who would be ok with that trade? Barring Fultz not working.", "I dont know ... in my amateur opinion I feel Lowry is too old(33-34yoa) for a $33 Million year deal... then it's up. Doesnt feel like a fit for the Orlando Magic bill. Plus the trade chips they would want (Gordon, Bamba, or Issac) would hypothetically be the pieces that would put us competing.\n\nI smell Lakers, Clippers, ... or maybe even Nuggets or Mavericks being desperate at some point next season for Lowry. Nuggets could shift Murray to SG with Lowry Running Point. Just doesnt feel like Lowry fits with Magic currently or in near future", "I essentially agree. Just know we need to make win now moves at some point. Still may be too early, but if we are looking at a top 3 seed, I can see us pulling the trigger. A mix of DJ, Fournier, Bamba, and picks could get us maybe like a Lowry+OG trade? It's a stretch but if we feel like this year is ours, we could do it. It would be low risk since he's gone the very next year and opens up a Max space. \n\nOutside of that, I can see them trading to one of those trade destinations. I'm not saying I want Lowry. I'm just saying I could see us taking a shot if he becomes available.", "I dont think Orlando Magic FO is going to trade this season unless the \"Run It Back\" plan falls short.  Feels like they're building the culture to be appealing to a free agent. I believe DJ's contract is up after next season. I also believe Mike Conley's deal is up with Jazz after next season, or it's a player option.  I think front office wants to build a team that has players knocking on the FO door... not FO trying to drag potential Free Agents through.\n\nWe're not sure how Markelle fultz will pan out yet.  However, I have a hunch MCW will be on the Orlando Magic after next season as the back up. Question is though who will be the starting Point Guard for Orlando Magic 2020-2021?... Markelle Fultz... Free Agent acquisition Mike Conley or even Kyle Lowry.", "I definitely agree it looks like they're going to try to run it back this year and I honestly think that's going to work well. However if it doesn't, I can definitely see them trying to get rid of some pieces if necessary as there is a lot of good expiring contracts out there.\n\nI'm part of the camp that really believes that markelle is looking better than we know. I don't know that MCW has what it takes to be a backup, but I think that Kell it's farther along than we think and I believe that the front office knows that. Every thing that they are doing really looks as if they believe markelle is a future building block for us. I trust these guys because they're smart and I really don't think that they would do that unless they know he is all right and looking good."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

Unfortunately a big part of that is the fact that Shaq, Mac, and Penny all left or got hurt in the case of Penny kind of at the peak of their productive years. Mac left and dominated the year D12 got drafted, Shaq went to play with Kobe and got a ring, and Penny got hurt and then left.

Nobody ever mentions though that we\u2019ve been building around Vooch for 8 years and we have two playoff wins to show for it. We had dipo, Tobias Harris, Fournier, Gordon, Isaac, fultz Ross and as a score of other role players and coaches. Yet the net result is 2 playoff wins. Dwight was also a 3 time DPOY and our team would not be nearly as good with Vooch who\u2019s basically a negative on defense. Dwight was also a multi time all nba and MVP candidate. Vooch hasn\u2019t even scracthed the surface of that. Vooch is a better skilled offensive player, but Dwight was putting up similar number totals with basically no skill and just sheer force. Do you kind of see my point?\n\nI agree that Vooch is very good, but if we are gonna have revisionist history for the Dwight years, maybe we should look at the Vooch years too and see if he takes any blame for the failures and ask, why is our team so bad for so long?", "I meant to add that we were the best offensive in the league for the last 11 games before the bubble. Obviously, I'm still not awake yet.", "We never built around Vooch. It just happened that he was the best of the players we received in the Dwight trade that stuck around. \n\nHe probably still is the best of the players even today, although Dipo and Harris have had good seasons, but it helped that both of them were surrounded by much better talent than Vuc has this year. Vuc is now averaging 24 PPG, the most any Magic player has averaged since T-Mac. In fact, only T-Mac and Shaq have had higher averages than Vuc is averaging now when playing for the Magic.\n\nT-Mac, who is a Hall of Famer, never made it to the 2nd round with the Magic. Yes, they won more playoff games, but that's because T-Mac was insane. Vuc is not or will never be at his level, but few players have ever been there.\n\nIf you put Dwight on this team, the last 8 years, you'd probably get a few more playoff wins, but I doubt he would have led the team by himself to the finals. Dwight would have made the defense much better, but he needed shooters around him to work the best on offense. We haven't had anyone close to the shooters we had then, except Fournier and that's just in the recent years.", "Is there any validity about the fact that certain players attract other talent? Or is there any validity to the fact that it\u2019s easier to build around certain players than others? Why has Vuc, who according to this sub is a superstar, not attracted other talent to help him win? \n\nIf you really wanna do the exercise and place players in different eras, I\u2019d say it\u2019s tougher for us to bring in guys like hedo and rashard with Vuc instead of Dwight. Does Vuc only start developing into a star at 29? Or is he a full fledged all star at 22-23 like Dwight and allows you to build for years ahead?\n\nIf Dwight is on this team now and in the years Vuc has been, I think the odds are better that one of the many disgruntled superstars that changed teams, at least thinks about joining him in Orlando, simply due to his standing as the best big man around (when he played). I guarantee not one guy thought that about Vuc In his entire tenure. Not a single one. \n\nThat\u2019s said, It\u2019s never useful to put players in the context of other eras. But you can look at what they have accomplished and take stock in that. Resume is limited: 1 all star, no all NBA, no All defense, 2 playoff wins and a horrible losing record across his time here. Is there an inkling that we compete for a title with Vuc as the best player? No.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that Vuc is not good or loyal or that he shouldn\u2019t be cherished by the fans. But like Tmac (who I agree was far superior, and who\u2019s teams btw were way worse) he is largely inconsequential in the gran scheme of things. Just a guy who is having a great season that is fun to watch but produces no real results. For some fans that might do, but for most winning really counts. \n\nSo I find it\u2019s kind of misleading to say \u201cVuc would\u2019ve been great in Dwights shoes\u201d. No, Dwight led us to our most successful run. Vuc has simply led us to no real team success, and it\u2019s insane that people give him a pass for it. Plenty of people used to shit on Dwight for bad offense and missing free throws while he led us to multiple deep playoff runs. I don\u2019t really get why we have to treat Vooch with mittens when we see no results from his tenure as our \u201cbest player\u201d. Time for accountability.", "He's not a superstar. He's a star and should be an All-Star this year, but he's not a generational player like T-Mac and Dwight. But I think he can become an all-star for the next few years because his game is perfect for the current NBA.\n\nThat said, to blame him completely for the losing here would be like blaming Beal in Washington. Beal is an amazing player, but the teams around him has not been very good. Even Doncic and Curry have struggled to win this season despite both being superstars. \n\nWinning in the NBA takes a lot of things to go right. Dwight had the coach, surrounding talent and the mindset to win at the beginning. Then he let his ego get to him and that's when the team started losing early in the playoffs, despite his generational talent.", "Fair enough. The fact remains though, that Vuc has not won anything, whether of his or someone else\u2019s doing. And at the end of the day, context without winning is basically useless. Franchise success is not counted by the metric of player loyalty, guys who play hard or guys who want to be here. It\u2019s simply winning and he\u2019s done none of it. If he tout the guys as \u201cuntraceable\u201d and \u201call Nba level\u201d I think it\u2019s more than reasonable to have him be at least somewhat responsible for the teams success or failure.\n\nThat said, I understand if fans can take his play and enjoy it for what it is. An all star performance in an otherwise lost season. I get that this can be a light in an otherwise dark period for this team. Personally, I\u2019ve been following the magic since the Shaq and pennydays , long before Vuc, and to me he is not the Magic GOAT by any metric. I do wish he would\u2019ve have been good enough to lead our team to some playoff success. I don\u2019t think we can win a championship with him as our best player and championships is what we should be shooting for."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

I could see him allowing us to do a sign and trade just as a thing of good faith. I just don\u2019t think Weltham is going to want to spend a fuck ton of money on Vuc when he doesn\u2019t fit the direction this team is heading, and also allowing him to walk allows us to tighten up our bench so when we have a player or 2 out we don\u2019t have Amile Jefferson and Jarrell Martin playing big minutes backing up fucking Wes Iwundu and Khem Birch.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Birch and Wes have played decent for us this year, but both are far from good on the offensive side, and our bench is literally just T Ross and friends on the offensive side. I\u2019d much rather prefer re-signing T Ross as he\u2019ll be cheaper then Vuc and, in my opinion, means more to a team then Vuc (Actually think about it, their roles, and what other players in their position can do) and handing the keys over to the young guns on the team."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

{"Title": "[Mod Post] A thank you from us, to the Orlando Magic community here on /r/OrlandoMagic.", "PostID": "bgvi5h", "CreatedUTC": 1556117292.0, "UpVotes": 202, "UpVotesRatio": 1.0, "PostURL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/bgvi5h/mod_post_a_thank_you_from_us_to_the_orlando_magic/", "PermaLink": "/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/bgvi5h/mod_post_a_thank_you_from_us_to_the_orlando_magic/", "SelfText": "Good morning everyone,\n\nAt the beginning of this year, a brand new team of moderators were brought in to /r/OrlandoMagic to help run the community smoothly. We all wanted to do our best to moderate when needed, to acknowledge feedback to improve the overall look and feel of the sub and make sure peoples voices were heard.\n\nWe were all pretty new to moderating, so there were some things we had to learn on the fly. We ended up with a really great group of fans whose passion for the team really showed during the year when times were rough and threads and comments got a little out of control. The community as a whole though survived the rough times and banded together for a run at the playoffs, and even achieving a playoff birth. Though it ended badly, the year spent watching and talking about games with fellow fans was really a great experience for all, for myself especially.\n\nI wanted to take the time to thank everyone here on behalf of the moderators, for supporting the Orlando Magic and having patience with us as a new mod team. I also wanted to address some feedback we received during the poll I took earlier about the sub and community as a whole. We had nearly 600 results, with one incredible response from a jar of peanut butter. Our fandom stretches across many types!\n\nYou can view the feedback results [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n43Exa5_o1sTZUyZ8PeerpvZf3N0RKFS42gR8P51VHI/edit?usp=sharing), and here as [charts based on responses](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15j5mAHlTGQ6H_snQQLGVd5wxOKqKyrTq5PETyDqQyDM/viewanalytics).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I will work on flair availability during the Summer. With new and old Reddit being a thing together, it makes creating flairs really weird and causes some bad results, jamming text together, overrunning into other text and so on. This has been commented about throughout the year and touched on in the survey. I'll make a post letting everyone know when flairs will be properly available again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Moderating toxicity in the sub is tough to manage, as we do not want to overly police peoples comments, but at the same time a line has to be drawn when it becomes too much to handle and derails threads from their original point and discussion. I think we as mods did a fair job in this regard, having to ban a few users to make reading comments tolerable once again for both contributors and lurkers alike. And while we're not the morality police, we're also not paid to do this and volunteer our time, so we'll handle situations on a case by case basis and make the calls we believe are best for the community as a whole. Words aren't just words, people exist behind keyboards and can be effected by constant taunts and trolling. And no, the lamagix ban will never be lifted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Daily topic threads were requested in comments during the year and in the survey. I think the idea is great, and while we have Monday Moan and Free Talk Friday, some stickied discussions about the team and such throughout the summer would be good to keep folks involved during the long off-season. We'll pow-wow about the ideas and are open to suggestions for weekly discussions for the sub. Great feedback.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* More Meet-Ups and Giveaways: I really enjoyed this part of being a moderator. I made quite a bit of e-mails to finally to establish a good relationship with those with in the organization, so these types of events took a while to develop and get going. Once they did though. during this year we had multiple fan pack giveaways (Thank you to the Magic for supplying these amazing packs!), an autographed Mo Bamba jersey (Thanks to Greer Love and Mo Bamba for this contribution), and a fantastic meet-up on March 8 (Thanks to the group sales folks with the Magic for this event!).For next season, I'm looking to have multiple meet ups throughout the year for Magic fans, and am hoping to have a very official Reddit Night with the Orlando Magic (listed on their website and calendars).\n\n*This will include all future workings with the Magic, including discounts, tickets, giveaways, etc. Everything given so far has been directly from the Magic, and I hope they continue to work with us through next season!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Fans are asking for more clips and highlights after games. This one is a little bit outside of our control and really we rely on fans to create these types of products for the sub. If there is a specific site or video maker who posts highlights regularly then I'd like to know the resources so I can keep an eye out for when they are posted after games. Fans, please continue to post these highlights throughout the year. People definitely want to see them!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are a bunch of other great points made in the survey that touch on many topics, such as controlling the quality of the posts made in the sub, more memes and increasing the 3 Point Percentage of the team. And while we can cull the posts, I ask that the community think about the quality of the comments and posts they're putting up, as this place would not exist without you. We want to encourage discussion and quality feedback. I myself thoroughly enjoy an over the top all caps title from time to time, but we want to make sure we also have a great amount of thoughtful posts about the direction of the team, its players and so on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I didn't directly address your feedback in this post that doesn't mean it went unread. I read every single response and all comments will be considered as we look to improve the sub and community experience for next season.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for subscribing to /r/OrlandoMagic and supporting the Magic!

He did in game 1 come out of his coma for 2 big shots later in the game. Other than that has been a liability. He has been owned by Wesley Matthews too.\n\nEvan would be a great bench guy on a contender. **The team is finally growing beyond Evan and it is showing.** I am sure the FO sees this and would like to make a change if they can. His trade value right now is pretty low.\n\nOur best bet is to see if we can get something in return for Evan's expiring contract assuming he exercises his player option. If we can't get anything worth even a medium-sized shit back in return then we move him to the 2nd unit and let him go in FA the next year. In the meantime focus on drafting a SG in this draft. I would love to see us go after the GS or MIN pick. Edwards could be nice to plug in next to Fultz. Not exactly sure how that trade could be put together money wise? We would likely lose Gordon+?  in the mix. Would like to see us reach for something.\n\nIf we stay @ 15 the SG market gets a bit bleak unless a Vassell, Maxey, or possibly Nesmith slips down. Otherwise, we will have to rely on making some surprise pick no one saw but us(thinking Chuma possibly) or construct some sort of trade that nets us a player or moves us up in the draft.\n\nWe got a lot to look forward to next season as we continue our all be it slow march into NBA relevance.

Vuc is making $28 mil a year to be a 1st-2nd option and Fournier is making $17 mil a year to be a 2nd-3rd option for the Orlando Magic. Vuc is getting a lot of praise because he is playing well now, he got criticized in games he played bad or in the Toronto series.. just like any NBA player with a lot of experience for a team that has lost for years and years. \n\nIf this was rookie-3rd year Vuc and he got some incessant amount of hate, I would agree with you but like most people he got a lot of leeway when there were bad games that veterans don't get the benefit of the doubt of.\n\nThirdly, it's visceral because THEY ARE the first and 2nd options on offense, even if they shouldn't \"have\" to be. Does that mean it's their fault? No. Some people think they're impeding improvement from others, others think that they're the best options we have, and both could be right. Fournier-Vucevic has been a mainstay through our losing years and while that doesn't mean THEY are the reason we lost, some want us moving on from a pair of players that we know are 2nd/3rd options (in Vuc's case) and 3rd/4th options on really good teams because we've tried it and there seems to be a ceiling.\n\nWe've been a bad team for a long time. People want to go in different directions. I've seen many of the free agents they want to bring in be white players, so it certainly has nothing to do with some weird anti-white bias you're accusing people of having. \n\nI agree Vuc has transformed his game improving his defense, passing, and having three point range. There's no way you can call Fournier an \"incredible defender\" though because it's simply not true. Advanced stats show it, watching games show it. He battles hard (at times) and draws difficult matchups but it's not like he's Marcus Smart or something. In fact, he gets targeted just like most of our guards.\n\nI don't know. Blaming race just seems like you're saying there is nothing to criticize about Evan when there is. And it's strictly basketball related if people don't want him on the team anymore. I don't want Evan, DJ, Aminu on the team and I would be open to trading most of our guys except Isaac and none of it has anything to do with race.

Cliff makes a game plan to make him shine (down screens). You can possibly do that with any of those other players. Fournier would avg 15ppg anywhere else. His PER is around 16 LMAO. He is a high usage role player.\n\nNo one game plans for him. You don't gameplam for a player that doesn't disrupt your defense and cant even give you 20ppg. Hes not a natural scorer and a terrible play maker. Its sad how easily impressed some of you are. Just really really sad.", "Low PER for both. No stats proving they are a + on the floor. Let's not forget the low offense efficiency rating of this team as well as other  offense categories we at the bottom in. High usage low impact players. Hmmm I wonder what their stats look like against teams over .500 (where we are 5-23 against them). But the offense is fine right?  \n\nNot sure what this has to do with AG. Nice try, though. You eurobum fans are hilarious.", "Come back in here and defend your mans! LMAO", "Agree completely.  The big thing is that, as many have said before, we aren't going to bring in any big time FA.  Our only hope is to trade some of our talent and try to get a true superstar and hope we can get him to sign.\n\nThe most paralleled build I have seen this way in recent years is probably Houston.  They were never seen as a big free agent destination, so they built a solid team and just waited for an opportunity.  Traded for Harden and bet on him staying.  Worked out and now they are a contender, even if it is their own weird way.  The big take away is that they don't have to sell free agents on \"come play in houston\" anymore, they can sell \"come play with Harden\".  In my opinion, this will be Orlando's most likely strategy of getting people to want to play here.", "> he takes and makes more threes\n\nLmao I thought the stats were empty??\n\n> no one game plans for him\n\nLmao so defenses DON\u2019T game plan for the opposing teams top scorer??\n\nThis logic is really really sad", "I still don\u2019t know how you think the offense should be run. Do you think the highest PER player should be running it? If so, that\u2019s a strange plan for running our offense. PER isn\u2019t a great catch-all, and especially so for determining efficient offense. Offensive box plus/minus or Offensive Rating are far better at such measures. Vooch is number one in PER anyways, but that\u2019s not why he\u2019s our best offensive weapon.\n\nWhat exactly are you proposing for the offense? What are their stats against +.500 teams? What are the rest of the teams stats against those teams?\n\nI certainly do wish Vooch and Fournier we\u2019re playing better, but honestly they\u2019re playing at the level of above average or even good starter\u2019s levels. Who else on the team can say that? Certainly not Fultz. By any metrics he\u2019s a bottom tier starting point guard. Gordon? Same for a forward. Then who else is there? Ross is crap this year, Isaac is injured, Aminu is injured, DJ is injured.\n\nYou simply aren\u2019t going to win many games when you can only field two above average players. So blaming those two guys is stupid.", "They are empty stats considering his 18.7ppg and whopping 16 PER.\n\nAnd you do not game plan for a role player. Show me vids of teams game planning for Fournier. Show me how teams disrupt our offense? Or better yet..tell me. You can't because you don't know basketball. LMAO\n\nFan of the team but doesn't understand the game. Very sad.", "LMAO imagine a coach going to his team in practice the day before a game \u201calright fellas, we\u2019re playing Orlando tomorrow. The team is full of role players, so we\u2019re not going to plan our defense. Don\u2019t stress about going whether to go under or over screens on Fournier or Ross or MCW or Birch, just do whatever you feel. We won\u2019t be able to disrupt their offense.\u201d", "In our situation due to not having a star and not being very competitive teams usually do not game for our weak offense.  Neither Evan or Vuc attract double teams. Our offense is bad and has no structure which was evident in the Miami game when Cliff couldnt read zone. It's evident in our 3rs qtr collapses. \n\nYou are very very naive if you think teams gameplan for every team they play. At most they do is in game adjustments. But of course you wouldn't know that because you don't know basketball.", "You are very very ignorant if you think professional NBA coaches and players don\u2019t do their due diligence for every single game", "Hahaha.

We played without PGs and sometimes without any guards at all. There were a couple of games we didnt have any centers available. We needed time to build chemistry. Paolo has improved his outside shooting and defense. Franz was cold to start the season from 3. Mo Wagner's intensity is infectious. \n\nI get that he has a better impact than the counting stats suggest, but he's also not as impactful as people make him out to be. There are also questions about whether he'll be able to play with that type of defense and hustle all season without getting injured, and whether he can still make those open threes (he has made only two 3s in the last 7 games). \n\nI will give Markelle credit, he has been solid overall and im loving his effort, but i dont think he has proven he can be a long term starter yet. Im sure i will get downvoted for this, and i dont care. I feel like if you take any objective NBA fans opinion, they would rank Markelle in the bottom 10 starting PGs. The way people here talk about him you'd think he's top 10. \n\nIm not sure Cole is a starting PG either TBH, so this isnt me pushing for Cole to become the starter, but we have to give Cole credit too.

Gleague rentals that never played in the NBA were given key minutes and a revolving door of starters including most of the times it being a gleaguer. The only person who was consistent the whole year was Franz and that why he should have been ROY since he largely kept this team from being a sub 10 win team. \n\nNow this roster lost it's clear GLeaue influence everybody in the starting and bench unit at least seem like real NBA players, most having already established names.

Fuck what he did last year, they treated Ross like 4 high school teammates at the Y who needed to pick up one more guy to run 5s! They repeatedly missed him when he was open and in rhythm, but this is a serious question, no sarcasm. Are these 7 players able to keep TRoss out of a rotation of a team that\u2019s trying to make the playoffs? (not saying that\u2019s us) It seems like the TRoss lack of appreciation is just to see all the young boys on the floor together. Listen if we are bottoming out and developing I agree 100%, but we haven\u2019t played a minute yet and the best players should get the minutes. If we\u2019re playing to win Chuma will be in a dog fight for the back up 3 minutes, because Terrance Ross\u2019 game isn\u2019t the easiest to adjust to but Cole and Jalen will be better at finding him when he\u2019s open which will in turn help his numbers, also playing with Mo and JI off the bench will do numbers for TRoss. it\u2019s called FAMILIARITY.

But he was really good the last 40 games. Impacts the game on both ends.", "I\u2019ve been saying it for a while, but this team is absolutely built to win 35+ games with a chance to compete for the play-in, and that\u2019s not even factoring in any potential leap for players like Suggs, Franz, or Fultz. We need to compete this year and show the young players that this is a team with championship aspirations. We cannot afford to keep stifling young players by holding them out and tanking anymore.", "Yeah I agree. I\u2019m okay with rolling out there and seeing what we have in these young guys to start the season.  But, if we are going to maximize the potential of Paolo, Franz, Carter, and Fultz we will need to have guys who play a role. We will need people who can shoot.\n\nThat\u2019s why going after Mitchell makes so much sense to me. Get rid of a couple young non-shooting pieces and get a real shooter/scorer from the outside.", "This. He absolutely balled out his last one.", "The Torch is lit!", "Simply put, based on most recent evidence, yes!\n\nI'm sure he is better than he showed last year but I don't want a guy around who mentally checks out when it doesn't look like we are going to compete.

But he just doesn't fit right now", "Who are we shipping then?", "All the numbers sound good, but at the end of camp he has to had OUTPLAYED TERRANCE ROSS or he\u2019s the odd man out PERIOD. Projected on the bench would be Cole Harris Chuma /Ross with Issac and Bamba followed by the 3rd stringers. Chuma will also have to fight Moe Wagner for the minute when Issac won\u2019t play. If Chuma is as great as you say he is, he is going to have to prove it this year because every position is loaded except Small Foward.", "I like Mitchell if he knows that he comes second in the pecking order after Paolo. I'm just not sure Utah wants a bunch of questionable assets that Orlando has. I like the young crew, but I don't think any combination of Fultz/Suggs/Isaac/Bamba/Harris/ Ross/Anthony gets you close to Mitchell without 4+ first round picks included.", "The team NEEDs veterans. Who do they have that has been around for a long time? Lopez is gone. If Ross is all in, him and Harris can help keep the structure. Maybe he checked out last season but the team on paper this year has the potential to be significantly more exciting than last. Shit just a fully healthy Fultz can improve TRoss's game significantly. If Ross wants to stay and is buying in and happy that the tanking is \"over\", then he's a great person to have around", "If the team needs veterans and Ross checked out last year but wants to show up this year. He is literally the worst person to have around.\n\nTerrible example and despite his years in the league isn't setting a great example. I'm not sure what he's going to teach them other than to give up when things don't look too good.", "A part of me wants to believe that he was really just helping the tank, like his fall was so huge, completely disinterested at points, yelling( a bit stronger than I mean but I cant think of a lesser word) at teammates (mostly Mo) and really really bad defensively/spotty mostly bad offense.\n\nI would like to believe he was just all in on tanking, and if its that and the Ross we see each time this team made playoffs recently can resurface then yes he is valuable if this team wants to make playoffs. A part of me still rather go all young, and give him and Gary limited minutes/ fill in minutes mostly. JI will be limited most likely so clearly one of them(Ross/Gary) will get a decent amount of pt early on but I dont want it to be like that whole year unless we can see them showing the Gary from Nuggets and Playoff Ross."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}
