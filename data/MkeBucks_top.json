I\u2019ve been following you guys for the past 4 years as you\u2019ve grown to be my favorite east team and you guys have always been such a joy to watch. 2019 was a tough one as I was hoping to face off against you guys in the finals but the raptors ruined both of our title hopes. While my team has been recovering from injuries the past couple of years, I\u2019ve been hoping you guys win your title, but it hurt seeing you guys fall short.

But through the roller coaster that these playoffs were from the nets series, to Giannis\u2019 injury, to being down 2-0 this series, seeing these images tonight just makes me so happy!

Saying \u201che couldn\u2019t get it done initially\u201d is highly disrespectful to his level of skill at that time. He was already playing like one of the GOATs then. In 2009 the Cavs went 66-16 and had a Net rating of +10.0. It was the Cavs at their best. Lebron had a BPM of 13.2 and VORP (value over replacement player) of 11.8 (both historic numbers). The second best player on the team? Mo Williams, with a BPM of 2.3 and VORP of 3.1. Basically, Lebron was CARRYING. The playoff numbers? Lebron averaged 35 PPG, 9.1 Rb, and 7.3 assists. He also had a BPM of 17.5, a RIDICULOUS stat. For context, Giannis\u2019s BPM this whole playoffs was 9.9, which is amazing. It still wasn\u2019t even close to Lebron\u2019s.\n\nThe Bucks playoff BPM in order goes: Giannis 9.9, Khris 2.6, Jrue 2.4, and Brook 2.1. Meanwhile the 09 Cavs: Lebron 17.5, Delonte West 1.0, Ben Wallace 1.0. A clear difference. In 2010, Lebron\u2019s last season with the Cavs in his first stint, the help only gets worse. \n\nDid Giannis do it the hard way? Yeah, he didn\u2019t join a super team and won in glorious fashion. Did Lebron leave because \u201che couldn\u2019t get it done\u201d? Bruh, that\u2019s just a disrespectful way to put it. He left bc they weren\u2019t surrounding him with the right pieces. They simply weren\u2019t going to get it done unless Lebron went god mode, which he was already doing. Let\u2019s not discount greatness, okay? Giannis did something incredible, but it\u2019s not like he carried a bunch of sad sacks. Milwaukee did a better job at surround Giannis with talent, much better than early CLE with lebron.", "I mean it\u2019s Mahomes and he made 2 straight Super Bowls and won one (just typing that makes me happy for him but incredibly sad at our FO\u2019s stupidity).

But let's say Ohio State beats Wisconsin in the CCG and both get in, Ohio State gets eliminated, and then Sconnie wins it all (or plug in any other combo of conference opponents). The shit-talk would be endless. It would absolutely not be justified, but it would happen.", "Lmao so you want to make a statement about Giannis not being the best player in the league but you can\u2019t actually tell me who\u2019s better and defend your statement?

If he didn't sign the supermax it would basically throw every mid market owner into a fit of rage because it would be another example of how the supermax doesn't actually work (it doesn't keep guys with team's that drafted them if they really just want out and it has hamstrung teams with albatross contracts for guys who *probably* shouldn't have gotten them) \n\n2. Lebron on the Lakers actually isn't good for the league monetarily. Both the Lakers and Lebron are ratings juggernauts in and of themselves, and Lebron playing for a mid market Cavs team in a time zone without *that* many ratings draws kept that 7-8 EST TV timeslot afloat ratings wise. Since he went to the Lakers ratings for early games have plummeted and by extension league TV ratings on the whole have gone down.

Was hoping to have someone to watch the mother effin EASTERN CONFERENCE FINALS with.", "KD was pretty much the only option on his team all series. He had some of the best guys on D in the league on him all series. Giannis (DPOY), Jrue (KD calls him the most underrated D player in the league) and Tucker. He made shots Giannis could only dream about. He dragged his team to game 7. Stats be damned.\n\nI really can\u2019t blame you for wanting it to be true. I want it to be, too. But if you watched the series, you know, and so does everyone else. Sorry man.", "There's no way you think this is true. I'm stoked the bucks won but after kyrie's injury with a hobbled harden, the ONLY thing keeping them in the series was KD. He had to play nearly perfect in game 5 and it was still a 1 possession game at the end. He is not 95% as good on offense man stop it.", "Cmon man. Giannis is playing a bad defense. Kd is playing against 5 elite defenders.", "95% as good lmao, let me know when Giannis can hit more than one 3 in a row. in fact let me know when he can hit more than 2 free throws in a row", "[removed]", "BUY A PLANE YOU CASUAL", "> He had some of the best guys on D in the league\n\n36 yr old pj tucker guarded him 99% of the series and was never double teamed.

Kd was better", "at stretching the floor and shooting free throws? absolutely\n\nKD is the greatest scorer in NBA history, he excels at literally every facet of putting the ball in the hoop: drives, pull-ups, turnarounds, post game, getting fouled and hitting free throws, threes\n\nI don't even like KD but come on. it's 5 year old logic to say that because Giannis scores almost as many points as KD he's 95% the scorer lol", "lol how do you propose scoring from anywhere beyond 6 feet from the rim?", "People also voted for Coldplay and the nazis you cant trust people", "Kd can't defend", "Excels at all of it yet gets worse results than guys like Kawhi \ud83d\ude44\n\nObsession with aesthetic ruins ability to assess basketball.

Middleton/Jrue/Lopez couldn\u2019t get anything on him", "aesthetics? it's called ability\n\nhaving the ability to take what the defense gives you is what raises the floor for championship level teams. Brooklyn gave giannis wide open threes and he'd brick them. Milwaukee gave Durant tough contested mid range shots and he still drilled them at an efficient clip", "funny that you have to bring other players up when I'm just trying to compare KD and Giannis", "lol that's such bs", "Does Durant drive anywhere near as well as Giannis or Shaq or Lebron?\n\nBeing more versatile does not make you better. Kobe was more versatile than Jordan, and Jordan has said as much, but everyone capable of a bit of thought can recognise Kobe was not the same level scorer.\n\nEspecially funny that you talk about Durant as a floor raiser when basically all his success has come as a ceiling raiser. That shooting ability means he benefits more from decreased attention. It does not mean he is actually better when teammates are running at 49% efficiency like Giannis\u2019s were all series.", "Not really sure how you figure durant is more versatile than giannis when giannis is probably better at almost everything besides shooting.", "there is no type of shot other than a jumper that kd is better at. \n\ndunking?

Giannis may be able to dunk from farther out but he needs more space and I'm not sure if he has as much of a soft touch around the rim as Durant does\n\nif Giannis could shoot threes at let's say 40% he would almost certainly be the best player in the league. versatility makes every other aspect of the game easier, it's synergistic\n\nversatility as a concept doesn't inherently make anyone better, no. like I'm not saying Evan Turner is better than Giannis just because he's technically more well rounded. he's a jack of all trades, but KD is elite in almost every facet of scoring. A near 7 footer like him should not be able to shoot like that or drive to the rim like he's a guard but he's able to", "hahahaha there's only one kind of jumper according to you but alley oops and dunks are in vastly different categories?\n\nthe mental gymnastics are astounding. and also KD has way better post moves than Giannis", ">\tAnd I would say Durant is a better driver than Giannis because he has a much tighter handle on the ball. Giannis may be able to dunk from farther out but he needs more space and I'm not sure if he has as much of a soft touch around the rim as Durant does\n\nThis is just\u2026 awful analysis. What exactly do you think Durant is doing if multiple bodies collapse in on him like entire defences do against Giannis. Honestly I am not even sure about handle being a meaningful advantage for Durant considering his propensity to get tripped up or just turn the ball over, but even if we do give him that advantage, handles do not make you better at getting to the rim than someone as strong as Giannis\u2026\n\n>\tversatility makes every other aspect of the game easier, it's synergistic\n\nThe goal is not to merely make other aspects of the game easier on yourself. Just like with the switchability debate. Bam and Simmons can be more switchable than Gobert, and that can avoid some specific matchup issues, but in totality it does not actually make them better defenders than Gobert.\n\n>\tKD is elite in almost every facet of scoring. A near 7 footer like him should not be able to shoot like that or drive to the rim like he's a guard but he's able to\n\nThis is literally an aesthetic argument lmao. Jokic is now a shooting big who handles the ball more than Durant while being possibly the best passer in the league and winning MVP, but no one is circlejerking him as the \u201cbest player on the planet\u201d. Nor am I saying they should, but offensive effectiveness is not an argument for Durant. And neither is being 6\u201910\u201d or whatever \u2014 cool, Durant is tall, does that actually mean he scores more effectively than Curry or Lillard? Alright, maybe we can say Durant is better offensively than Giannis, but there are players even better than him, and Giannis despite having more \u201climitations\u201d is still right on his level, just like Shaq was not automatically worse on offence than Dirk simply because Dirk had more range.", "Lol all those post moves and he's 100d less efficient at it", "what?\n\nGiannis shot 40% from 3-10 feet this year\n\nKD shot 47% from 3-10 feet this year\n\ndon't talk out of your ass", "10 feet is a midrange j", "good job, you're close to realizing that a critical facet of many post moves is being able to actually shoot a jumper", "and yet despite this giant bag of tricks and skills hr shoots 20% less efficiently than giannis, doesn't do half the work on defence, shits the bed in OT missing every shot and airballs the final play.\n\ngenius skilled high iq kd couldn't think of a better decision than heaving w 10 secs on the clock"], "CommentLinkTitles": ["Reddit - Dive into anything", "Reddit - Dive into anything", "Dumb and Dumber: We're really doing it! - YouTube", "Lil B - Fuck KD (Kevin Durant Diss) [OFFICIAL VIDEO] - YouTube", "Reddit - Dive into anything", "Reddit - Dive into anything"]}

BUCKS WON THE CHIP BABY! LET'S GO!!! WHAT A GAME!  \nEasy likes aside:  \nGiannis has been playing the long con with his free throw shooting. After his fourth season, Giannis realized: his free-throw shooting was holding him back. He was simply too good. Since then, the Freak has pretended to be subpar at free-throw shooting, slowly, calculatingly worsening his shooting percentage in a believable way. It was a painstaking process, taking a toll on his pride, performance, and legacy.  \nOver time, teams adjusted to build a wall around Giannis. Teams changed the way they defended him. Players started intentionally fouling Giannis. This was all part of his plan. As he progressed in this season's playoffs, Giannis realized that he needed to commence stage two of his plan. He worsened his free-throw shooting as he always has in the playoff's (all according to plan), but this time, Giannis sent his self-sabotage to overdrive. He shot abysmally, fighting through every urge to simply swish those shots.  \nBut Giannis persevered, letting defenses and players become so ingrained in their sets, so set in letting Giannis get to the line that once he commenced stage three of his master plan, they would be powerless to stop it.  \nStage three: When it mattered the most, in game six of the finals, Giannis finally used his powers, going 17-19 from the line. The Suns didn't know what to do. They tried to stop fouling, but they couldn't. The had to choose between treating Giannis like Steph Curry, completely changing their defensive game-plan, or to take their chances and let Antetokounmpo got to the line. They decided to take their chances.  Wrong choice.  \nWith Giannis' flawless execution of his master plan, his purposeful free-throw tanking, his long con, Antetokounmpo won a championship, and a finals MVP. What a beautiful man.  \nP.S. Just figured I would let you guys know that I am not first and foremost a Bucks fan. I have been a Cavs fan for a while now, but since 2019, I have been quietly rooting for the Bucks (especially in the playoffs). I just felt disingenuous to not mention that fact.

Sure, they are not great at hitting 3s (especially Giannis), and sometimes they do rush on the shot clock and jack up 3s, which would be considered bad shots/decisions.  \n\nBut honestly the game is not as simple as \u201cwe\u2019ll just drive to the hole every time and dominate the paint.\u201d  Yes, they have great players for that mentality, but if you can\u2019t at least threaten to shoot from the perimeter, you won\u2019t have as much success in the paint. They shot very well from distance at times in the playoffs.  I don\u2019t think they ever deserved to be made fun of so much as if they\u2019re just dumb, especially that they were still in every series, even when they were down against Brooklyn and Phoenix.  This championship is more than enough to validate that winning is the bottom line, even if it doesn\u2019t look pretty.  They were phenomenally defensively in many games in the playoffs and that wasn\u2019t talked about much until the end.  But then again, we are in an era of sports that mostly glorifies flashy, high-scoring offense.

As I said, it wasn\u2019t because this is a hostile space, as everyone appears to be very friendly and simply wants to support their team. This has been made more apparent for me with how everyone has been so respectful towards to the sad passing of Kobe. I always wanted to say something, but was too nervous to join in with any conversations. I did, however, have to say something about one of the two men that made me fall in love with basketball.\n\nKobe & Giannis were the two that made me want to watch this incredible sport, but I was never going to support the Lakers. I immediately found myself gravitating towards the Bucks, and while I am aware that their recent level of performance goes against what is commonplace, there\u2019s just something special about this team, as a whole.

He was philanthropic. He was a mentor to other players. I think, fake or not, he significantly changed his image over the last 15 years. Obviously, I don\u2019t know anything more than his public image, but the world loves a good comeback story, and I think people can change.", "The rape case/accusations obviously were a big black eye for him, but I think it is important to realize how much he changed his life when he made mistakes. He had a quote about being human and said we all make mistakes \"we are all angels and we are all devils.\" He became involved with women's rights, specifically in athletics where he was a big advocate/mentor/teacher for a lot of women's college teams both at the collegiate and professional level. He also used a homophobic slur towards a ref and upon realizing how many people were affected by that completely changed his mindset, and even called out fans of his after that point in his career for using the same slurs he had used. Again I am not saying his mistakes should be forgotten or overlooked but I think it is important to realize that when he made mistakes he did what he could to learn from them and come out on the other end a better person.", "My first big celebrity death that hit me was Dale Earnhardt.

I think similar to kobe, a lot of people watched him grow up as a person and kind of grew up with him. I think back to Mac Miller's early music which was mainly just about being a kid, drinking, smoking, ect and compare that to what he was making and putting out towards the end of his life which was much more emotional and dove into a lot of the feelings that regular every day people experience. Kobe on the other hand transitioned from that absolute killer mindset where he wasn't friends with anyone to a role of a mentor and teacher to so many athletes and people in general.", "I don\u2019t know how, but I completely forgot about that.

At worst he could be shot in the legs once. The police are supposed to be trained to handle dangerous situations competently. And race may not have had anything to do with the shooting, we don't know for sure. However, statistically it is true that black people are more likely to be hassled by the police, and to be arrested for crimes that are committed to the same degree between races. So it is true that black people are treated poorly in general by the police. So when a black person is shot by the police, it's understandable that people see that instance as part of the trend.", "Oh yeah dude, \"the system\" has worked fucking GREAT so far.", "You should take a break from the internet.

That, in turn, increases accountability (if they\u2019re used, which, funnily enough, they just happen to fail at opportune times for the cops). It is no accident Kenosha PD has no body cameras but did have armored vehicles ready to go.\n\nAlso, when I say surveillance, I don\u2019t mean \u201csurveillance of cops\u201d, I mean \u201ccops surveillance of citizens\u201d. The militarization of police goes beyond weaponry and into techniques, like military-style information gathering, surveillance, and tracking.\n\nIncreasing training does nothing\u2014if it\u2019s bad training and you just teach it more, it just reinforces bad habits. It\u2019s about different training. And if you\u2019re worried about the cost of changing that training, just imagine how much money would be saved if taxpayers didn\u2019t have to cover the fees and payouts related to police malpractice.\n\nBut maybe those terms are still too general for you.

Who knows whether Trae and/or Giannis will be back, but hopefully we will be better prepared in Game 5 either way.\n\nOn offense, 38 points in a half is absurd.

Every sports fan seems to have this officiating victim complex, so I'm not meaning to take this all out on you.\nAs far as point of emphasis, all I can find is that they issue them at the beginning of seasons, much like the NFL, and at the beginning of the playoffs. I guess I didn't know about this, but I'd love something substantial supporting the idea that they send them out every game.", "Donaghy in his tell-all said that the refs met every playoff game that specific team refereed to discuss what they wanted and didnt want to call. If you choose not to believe him that's out of my control. But I think that sounds very logical and isnt damning of any wrongdoing. BUT, the fact that there were refs known to stretch series and if the team down 0-2 is getting all the calls that night imo really gives good support. \n\nYou say its just some conspiracy but we know it happened up until 2007 when Donaghy was forced to resign. Just because the FBI (an extremely corrupt org) said that no one else was involved doesnt make it true. I have heard all sides of the Donaghy story and it's my opinion that he is a total sleezebag but that he took the fall for the actions of many.", "Ok, that's fine man. You continue to toss off opinion as incontrovertible fact, but do you. I would say that, in the playoffs, a team that is down 0-2 that then begins to win also tends to happen because the second two games are often home games for the down team.", "I am willing to meet you in the middle and say that games probably aren't fixed on the level they may have been in the past but to act like it's not even a possibility is pretty silly\n\nRIP Kobe, Gianna and the rest of the people aboard that copter. Such a tragic story and I didnt mean to turn this into \"NBA cheats thread\" just an honest opinion that went through my mind. \n\n We know the league has cheated before, not sure why it's so crazy that it could happen again.

The problem is not the team but coaching. That what hurts because a good coach would have made adjustments to replace outmatched Lopez with Ibaka, Hill with Carter and give Nwora opportunity with Allen struggling. I have no doubt this series would have been over in our favor had Ibaka been put on Al in game 2 and after to free up Giannis and preserve his energy.

I know Middleton was injured but this doesn't mean we don't have issues as a team to solve. Also trying to make Holiday a scorer will not gonna work of course, he is too inefficient on that role.

It's true. The bench was mostly garbage bedsides Bobby and Pat at times.  Besides Giannis and Jrue (defensively) the team really underperformed. Giannis was totally gassed. If they weren't going to play Ibaka I really wish we would've kept Donte.  His D would've helped.  Why not give Nowra a few minutes to see if he can get hot?

My point is that Mitchell is a Diva that wants to play in a huge market where he can take 40 shots a game", "Yeah, but we could move Brook and GA which would free up space. Plus, let's be honest here. If the ownership wants to be a contender year in and year out, they're just going to have to fork over the luxury tax.

I\u2019m not in favor of overturning the 2nd amendment or anything I grew up around guns as my family are big hunters and I can understand the pleasure gained from going to a gun range I mean its a lot of fun like I get it but the fact of the matter is it\u2019s currently way too easy for people to illegally obtain guns. Beyond that the current background check system is not thorough enough to ensure that a gun is being sold to a responsible individual. Additionally the lack of training on how/when to use and maintain a weapon safely is also a big contributor in irresponsible gun ownership. I have a friend who has never shot a gun in his life but after living in a not so nice area for a while decided to buy a pistol in case he ever needed to protect himself.

He will not make meaningful adjustments, and will run different schemes for bursts and those are often very successful. We started the game with off ball movement, and tight defense.  There was some foul tribute thaf caused a bit of defensive shifting, but there was no reason for him to sit there and watch the Nets run without calling a timeout and messing adjustments. \n\nBud absolutely does not believe in calling timeouts to stop runs, and just watches leads get killed because he is obsessed with the drop zone defense and does not accept that it doesn't work in the playoffs. He also, doesn't accept that an iso only offense, with Giannis being the primary ball handler is possibly the worst way ever to use Giannis. So he runs point Giannis with a drop defense, and we go from up 17 to losing by 6.

The whole problem with Bud is that he can't stop Giannis from taking the ball and playing hero with it. Bud is quite familiar with the power of a 5-man offense. The problem isn't being able to write up plays (he's number 1 in the league for points in the possession directly following a time out), it's being able to control the star down the stretch.\n\nObradovic would backfire so spectacularly.

Tough love but not abrasive and an asshole.", "the rockets playstyle was absolutely horrid...", "How amazing does this part of the sentence sound?  \"... started with a quick first pass after the inbound and uses of screens to find mismatches and advantages.\"  Even that sounds good right about now.  We don't exploit like we should.  Long streches of game just shooting terrible 3s and then bursts of Giannis/Driving which brings it back.  When we win big its only when our 3 game is on point.  Otherwise we grind like no other.  Giannis is tough in pressure situations but lacks the composure to win games at the end and is a liability at the line when we absolutely need 2 on the possession.  Rambling now....sorry.", "I can't name a better post player then Brook in the NBA. He also hits his free throws. The nets have no one on their team that can guard him down low, it's so frustrating watching him not get the ball.", "The funny thing is that every one of you has come at me with an \u201che ALMOST\u2026\u201d. Which proves my point. The bucks have ALREADY ALMOST won a championship. So hey, why not hire someone who can help us ALMOST win a championship again. Take your homer hats off for a second.", "Yeah there were like 5 games with go-ahead runs scored in the 8th/9th the final week", "I forgot about Buckner.  Was that the 11 win year?", "Correct, the moment he stepped on the court the Nets immediately targeted him and switched him onto KD who splashed a 3", "Nah, a sports psychologist to get him out of his head.  NFL and college kickers use them all the time to help deal with the pressure and to not let the misses get to them.  A lot of pro teams across sports use them, and if Giannis isn't seeing one he needs to because he is so far in is head about free throws that a shooting coach isn't going to help. \n\n And if he is seeing one, he needs a different one, because mentally playoff free throws are in the same category as playoff field goals or being a playoff closer, and getting into ones own head in those spots is a recipe for disaster.  When Giannis dropped the ball at the end of the game it was clearly from him being overly worried about being fouled, and moving too fast.  If free throws weren't mentally fucking with him, he probably dunks that and ties the game.", "No. That\u2019s why I specifically only responded to the part where you said we lost home games against Miami in the bubble.", "They\u2019re probably a bunch of yes men who don\u2019t have the balls to tell him he\u2019s wrong. That whole coaching staff needs to go imo", "So if he is in fact The Great White Buffalo, why would he want to come to Milwaukee as opposed to some other team? Why not give Brad Stevens a dump truck full of money? I mean it\u2019s outside the box for sure and I\u2019m all about that. Just more wondering if he actually has an interest in coaching NBA and what the Bucks could offer him to invent him to take the job.", "I think you nailed it, but I also would hire someone like Obradovic because something's gotta give.  Either Giannis actually started hitting threes at at least a 35% clip, or he becomes The Big Fundamental 2.0 and frankly needs a coach that will really hammer that kind of shit.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll get my hopes up every year because I'm dumb, but I don't get the logic of thinking it's the coaches fault that we routinely come out with a gameplan that's working and then simply stop doing what got us leads.  Bud knows all about ball movement - the Hawks were one of the best in the league at it if memory serves.", "I disagree. This is your assumption from the clips of him freaking out, he coached my team for 13 years, got 11 chips, 7 cups and 5 Euroleague titles. He is still worshiped as a god, if you want to win you need a coach that wins.", "The rockets play style was the best style for the role players they had around Harden. Another way they would have lost more games. Only players they had to drive was harden, Paul and occasionally Gordon. Everyone else were catch and shoot only players.", "Yup. You put him to one side on a post up. Have Middleton throw it in from the three line and have Giannis on the other block. You either get Brook 1v1. Or if they try to double Giannis gets an easy dunk or Midds gets a three look. It's baffling that we don't even try...", "the bucks never got screwed because of an injury", "Coach Bud just does dumb shit. We should've been up 20+ in that first half.", "TRUE.  its clear hes to in his head with his shot.", "F", "To try invalidate my argument but they have shown zero backbone in elimination games last two play offs \n\nbubble or not", "> why would he want to come to Milwaukee as opposed to some other team? \n\nIt depends. Zeljko has one big negative: He is an a-hole. He is the best and he knows it. So he never even interviewed for a job before. The Suns tried to hire him and when they called him for an interview he basically told them \"My record is my interview\" and didn't go. It appears that all the winning in Europe has bored him out of his mind and is probably willing to play \"by the rules\" at least in the beginning.\n\nAs to why he would come to the Bucks, the answer is pretty simple, there's are only a couple of superstars available to be coached (Giannis, Dame, and Beal), and none of them would accept Zeljko other than Giannis. Not only that, Giannis is the only star that would do as he is told and take the verbal abuse that would be sure to come. Both Giannis and Khris went through much worse under Potatohead, and Giannis likes his coaches to have some edge.", "I can see that angle but I imagine Giannis is stubborn enough that he would bristle at someone like Obradovic. You need that middle ground I think.", "Euroleague is much different than the NBA in many ways.", "You\u2019re implying it was a play style used to fit the roster, they specifically designed the team to be that way for years and years.  Full tilt Moreyball is not the way to go in smaller sample sizes like playoff series because you\u2019re more vulnerable to the wild variations the 3 pointer brings like that epic 0 for stretch they had in game 7. To my knowledge, there\u2019s only been one finals winner who were top three in 3 point attempts and they had the greatest shooting duo ever. Imo D\u2019antoni would have similar problems Bud has had in the playoffs.", "That's the worst part, just like putting on Giannis on KD for a couple mins a qtr on defence, Bud doesn't even try it. Giving up these prime Giannis seasons is going to come back to bite the franchise in the ass.", "There was no reason not to be. Shaq and Kenny understood it too and called it out at halftime, anyone with basketball IQ could\u2019ve seen that collapse coming.", "I\u2019m not even arguing with you about that. I just think it\u2019s dumb to say we lost our \u201chome\u201d games against the Heat. I agree this team crumbles under pressure time and time again.", "Interesting perspective. Giannis certainly seems thick-skinned and he would readily take it from a euro coach. But what about the rest of the team? I just don\u2019t want to create a situation where we bring in Obramovic and then two years later everyone wants out with no hardware to show for it\u2014but then again maybe exactly what this team needs is tough love. I like it.", "Never said it's not, I just listed the titles I watched him win. He is an effective coach, Bud is not, if it is Bud or him there is no dilemma for me. Who would be an alternative from the NBA?", "I don't follow Euroleague but what I've seen recently is that the translation of guys like Doncic is challenging that assumption.", "The dude is just too stubborn to be a coach. He refuses to change anything. He just watches the team slowly die from doing the same shit", "It\u2019s so true.\n\nIt was weird seeing us get absolutely clowned at halftime when we were up 15+.\n\nThey knew, we knew, it seems like Bud was the only one who couldn\u2019t see it fucking coming.", "If this team can't win without Obradovic, I can't imagine any coach could do it. Also, he is a master at talent development, especially teaching them how to play defense (perfect for Nworuto, Item 80, and Mamadi). Also, there are only three guys that really matter Giannis, Khris, and Jrue. If they are onboard, the rest don't matter. Giannis and Khris will definitely be, and I think all that Jrue wants is to be a lifer and win.\n\nZeljko will not tolerate any stupid early shot 3s of ISOs just because a player felt like taking the shot. He will let his players play, but if you play stupid games you'll win stupid prices (bench) under Obradovic. That much is certain.", "Europe is producing a lot more NBA players recently. The top young superstars are all European: Luka, Jokic, Giannis.\n\nThen you have even younger, bizaro-players, like Poku.", "Ok you convinced me. Now to convince ownership\u2026", "> Now to convince ownership\u2026\n\nIt only takes one person: Giannis. If Giannis says, \"Give me Zejlko, and I'll give you two more seasons.

Yeah a batting average of .300 is good but batters make contact a lot more often than 3/10 times (foul balls, line/ground outs). The things that pro atheltes do in all sports is amazing and something that most people could never do but if you go up against a 100 mph fastball, it will be past you before you even blink the first time. You essentially have to decide what you are doing as the ball is actually leaving the pitcher's hand.

That way Giannis will be limited to only 22/13/5 for an entire series. So all you need is four all-time great defenders and Giannis is forced to average something around elite center averages. \n\nDamn they really got us!

He just needs to pin-point them better in the shooter\u2019s pocket and he will be LeBron.\n- Handling: his handling is already crazy good, especially at 6\u201911\u201d, but he is going to get it as tight as DJ\u2019s ass. So he is going to be even more of a nightmare driving and kicking the ball. \n- Shooting: He got his 3P from bad to average and he is about to get it to good or very good. He is also going to work on his FT, because according to Sullivan, they couldn\u2019t get his FT shooting down in time for the season.

Giannis has so many things he can improve on and he is already a top-3 player at 24yo when everyone else in front of his are at the very pick of their prime. \n\nGiannis with just a very reliable floater will be insanity.

But when your fellow teammates are shooting bricks and get weak knees in the playoffs, then the whole raptors team collapses on one player, the player that drives to the basket.

Toronto played a simple 3-2 then a Box & 1 zone. He continued having Giannis play point center to slash and kick. Was a train wreck getting clogged in the lane and causing repeated turnovers. I understand the tendency to stick to what produced 60 wins. Bud needs to look at how Coach K handles Lebron in the Olympics facing the same zones. On that first failing 2004 team Lebron was played very similarly taking the ball up against a zone. San Antonio then shut Lebron down with the same zone early in his career. That type of player needs to be moved to the high post and becoming the facilitator and distributor rather than a guy aimlessly running into a 3-man wall.", "You guys are delusional if you don\u2019t think Giannis\u2019 limitations were exposed in this series.

Leonard is best defensive player in the league, we have multiple top end defenders, and STILL we were relying on your guys missing those threes and Giannis missing those freethrows.

To do what Giannis is doing you have to be elite at reading defenses. Not only that, Giannis is frequently manipulating the geometry of the defense by moving around and making passes. The only thing he does yet have is insane pin-point accuracy that only a couple other NBA players have and passing out of the PnR.\n\nTL;DR: Giannis is elite at reading defenses and the most critical move to add, IMHO, would be a floater. Giannis\u2019 Eurostep is a work of art but the move itself is a double edge sword (of sorts). The action is very straight forward: you make a move, the defender commits, you to the other way. The issue is if the defender steps ups or steps diagonally (in your way) and has extra help AND your shooter isn\u2019t open or you don\u2019t have a good view. Such a scenario kills your the momentum of the Eurostep right at its most critical point and the counter to that is a post move.\n\nIMHO, the best post move for Giannis would be a floater and a hook. The floater allows you do kill the defense mid-motion, which would paralyze defenders as they try to figure out if its a Eurostep or a floater (the Harden effect) and the hook gives you a get-out-of-jail free card if your momentum dies. Just these two moves would get Giannis to a whole new level.

I see him staying if this next series is competitive, as long as he sees his teammates show up. Otherwise he's out. He's been very upfront about not being committed to Toronto, but at the same time not being a Kyrie or Lebron about it. The way I see it, he'd rather be in the finals then have to face the warriors in the Conference finals. Do i think it make that much of a difference? Not really, but it at least give Toronto a slight edge. \n\nAs far as the Knicks rumors, I discount those on principle. Everyone off season every star apparently wants to go to the Knocks or the Lakers. Its the media stroking their own ego, if he's about winning the Knicks make zero sense. If it's about his family, NY makes even less sense.

That proves my point.  When was the last time they did a state tour like the Brewers and Packers did/do? The Bucks definitely weren't doing them when I was growing up, yet the other two were. \n\n>They were also on Super 18 for a long time. Cable came to rural Wisconsin before it came to Milwaukee because it was invented as a medium for people in rural areas to get television.\n\nMost of rural Wisconsin is poor and can't always afford cable.  That is why radio is important and why the Bucks falling so far behind is a big deal.  If you can't watch or listen to the team,  it's hard to develop a Fandom. That's why having a good radio network is so important.  We have a poster below me who had that exact scenario and only because their parents were diehards already is why they're a fan today.  \n\n\n>There's a reason the rest of Wisconsin never embraced the Bucks.... and its THAT reason.\n\n\nAnd yet,  the rest of the state has had little to no issue supporting the Brewers,  Badgers(both football and basketball)and Packers, who have a ton of POCs. The Brewers actually ran into similar issues in the early 2000s. They had to rebuild the fan base that the seligs had killed off the previous 15 years.  So they did more outreach to the areas outside Milwaukee County and it worked. These are things the Bucks need to be doing \n\n\nJust maybe,  MAYBE some of the blame needs to go to Herb and the team for not making an effort over the past quarter century and putting money into things like a real radio network and going out into those communities to build relationships. There will always be the idiots who won't like the Bucks for tons of reasons.  We need to reach out to the vast majority who would give them the chance and allow them the opportunity to become fans.", "I think we're all in agreement that for as much as Herb Kohl is a likable guy, he was a horrible owner for no shortage of reasons.\n\nBut for as much as you can criticize a marketing strategy.

We need Donte to take another jump for sure, if his offense catches up he makes us way better. \n\nBledsoe honestly played great defense all series but he struggled offensively, though he had some nice passes/finishes. maybe a better coach can unlock him but i would\u2019ve rather had Brogdon", "Offense > Defense.  He's obviously bad at defending quick guards but as the other person said you don't have to put him on the 1 defensively, just have him guard the designated 'stand in the corner guy' every team has.  And let's just say you ignore that strategy like Indiana did all year, they still had a good defense because one bad defender is not the end of the world so long as you have good ones on the back end to make up for it (DPOY, Brook). \n\n A bad shooter on the other hand is way more detrimental to a good offense.  Bledsoe is given all the looks he wants while his guy sags off like crazy.  And defenses still haven't figured out he drives to pass. There's almost no need to help on him so long as it's not a wide open layup, just make him make a tough shot over someone vs. find a shooter for 3.\n\nTo me it's a no-brainer, Brogdon is a better overall player than Bledsoe and I think most neutral observers would come to the same conclusion. And he's younger.  17 and 7 assists this year at the point guard too (21/10 against this same Heat team in the playoffs) so this idea that he should play small forward over point has been put to bed imo.", "They should have kept Brogdon in hindsight, but I think he wanted to leave", "Maybe we can trade Middleton for Harden \ud83e\udd23", "Winning a championship in your first year and having a Hall of Fame coach certainly helps.", "Ah yes, dirk stayed loyal to the extremely small market team in...

I'm sure he doesn't love jacking up and missing 3s, but I have no doubt he was being encouraged to take them.", "I wasn't saying he should be playing the 3, but that is the position he is best equipped to defend.  If you have him playing the 1 or 2, then there is always going to be a defensive mismatch, as Middleton isn't fast enough to guard 2 guards.  What would have been ideal is if he were willing to come off the bench as a 6th man and stagger his minutes so that he was mostly playing with either only Khris or only Giannis, and have Khris guard the 4 in minutes they play together.

My main point is that the one you're describing is a smaller one than our current Bledsoe problem on offense.  \n\nIt really comes down to: would you rather have a defensive mismatch, which can be cleaned up by the bigs imo, or defenders leaving Bled all alone because he won't take or make threes?  That OKC/HOU series last week is a decent example, being able to sag that far off an offensive player is a serious problem and Indiana's defensive rankings show that a bad defender can be overcome; I watched every Pacers game this year and Brogdon defended the point guard 90% of the time, it wasn't pretty sometimes but it wasn't the end of the world.

All their stars have unpredictable personalities and are over 30 (edit: kyrie is 29). Kyrie has been injured or bad in pretty much every playoffs since the shot.

Without Giannis, the Bucks team that came out in Game 2 will need to come out every game and the K-Mid that came out in the 4th quarter of Game 3 will need to come out every quarter or damn near close to it. Only then will we have a chance without Giannis and coach Bud still at the helm.", "Some of the coaching decisions around the league are just mind boggling to me though, like Monty Williams deciding not to feed Ayton when he's going against Batum, Morris, and the Ghost of Demarcus Cousins.  How the hell do you only get him 9 shots when the Clippers didn't have Zu or Ibaka and Ayton had been averaging 20.25 ppg on 70% shooting, absolutely absurd.", ">  not unconvinced that we couldn\u2019t\n\nI've had better luck untangling earpod cords", "You go sit in a corner and think about what you've just done.", "Yeah for sure , the injury went from franchise changing to we\u2019ll get em next time type injury.

Can we stop with getting their personalities involved.", "That\u2019s fair. I\u2019m not saying they can\u2019t get along on the floor\u2014every game ive watched of them they meshed great. I meant it more in the sense of they\u2019ve all made moves in their careers that seemed really unexpected, even for a league where that happens all the time.

Giannis was an unknown commodity, but the few folks who saw him play raved about it how high his ceiling was and I was more than happy to let him grow for a few years even if it meant a few years in misery.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I'm no fucking Nostradamus.  I never would have guessed Giannis would be *this* good. I was hoping for a few All-NBA teams, not MVPs.  But to me it signaled a change in direction for the organization.  No longer would merely making the playoffs next year be the goal, now we were taking the future into consideration and trying to build a championship contender.  We were terrible next year and landed the #2 pick in (what was supposed to be) a stacked draft and y'all... I. was. STOKED.\n\nBoy, the journey was not what I expected but we eventually got here.

I mean ask the Hawks general fan base if we have any problems\u2026 I can tell you that you\u2019ll find very little on beef back and forth with our fanbases other than the friendly competition of your typical playoff matchup. Idk confuses me, at the start of the series I thought the majority of Suns fan base was likable, I mean two smaller market teams with long droughts facing off in the NBA Finals, but then after they take a 2-0 lead, and eventually go down 3-2 it\u2019s just been downhill with numerous accusations such as racism, wishing player injuries and invading opposing subreddits and being toxic with no proof. Did he end up giving you a link in the end? Even if he did there\u2019s always that one douche on the internet being a garbage human being, and I can say anyone that thinks like that does not speak for the majority of this fan base.

Players and coaches have figured this dude out and it's showing. He hasn't adjusted to that yet. Maybe he never will. But this is IMO coach Bud's biggest failure.

Bud can definitely coach in the playoffs, but he's still far greater in the regular season when he can be creative with rotations. Giannis didn't get the job done. We needed him to be a superstar on Kawhi's level, but he was more like your average all star caliber player. He choked a lot of FTs, and was largely to blame for Game 3, which would have changed everything. Kawhi elevated his game throughout the playoffs. Giannis was consistently worse than the regular season throughout the playoffs. That's the problem as it stands. Rest of the supporting cast was extremely inconsistent. Lopez, for example, went from an incredible Game 1 to complete shit until the last 4 minutes tonight. No one gave consistent performances. Refereeing was mostly a non factor in my mind, contrary to all the whining. Sure the refs suck in general, but we sucked it up a lot worse. One of Giannis, Middleton, or Bledsoe put in a decent performance in Game 3, and we break their spirit on the way to a series win.

While this season was far beyond what I thought this group could achieve, I still don't believe in their ability to accomplish the end result. Bledsoe is a huge problem going forward.

It never looked like The Raptors were scared of the moment. Meanwhile Milwaukee had too many guys who were afraid to shoot or were perfectly content taking a terrible shot. The Bucks can\u2019t re-sign Middleton to the max, he\u2019s at best the third best guy on a championship team...And as much as it pains me to say it, Kawhi straight up outplayed Giannis.  \n\nWarriors in 5", "I al both happy and dissapointed.\n\nWe overperformed all expectations and it's something to be proud of. We had our best result in 18 fucking years. 18!\n\nOn the other hand we had this series in the bag. 'eading 14 and 15 points in game 4 and 5 but we are unable to keep a lead. Bud is unable to adapt to their opponent.\nThe way we threw this series is borderline pathetic and I hope our players realize that.\n\nI dont know if a season will ve able to fix our players' inconsistency or if we need to get a 2nd star next to giannis to get better but I am hopeful (somewhat)", "its all about game 3. couldve stole it to go up 3-0, two straight overtimes where bledsoe shat away the first 3 possessions in each overtime. thats it really", "Sadly, this may be the best roster we ever have with Giannis on the team.", "This season was amazing, but if we want this team and Giannis to be who we want them to be, we were never going to walk there.\n\nWe weren\u2019t ready for the moment.

And I'll be back for it next year.", "What an absolutely absymal way to end what was a great season. \n\nWe just straight up fucking folded. \n\nBud hurt us all series long. Refusal to change his game plan when we were getting shredded. Stupid substitutions for no reason at all. Ruining all the momentum we built. Giannis and Middleton barely reaching 40 minutes is a goddamn joke. Happy they\u2019re rested for their summer vacation. \n\nThere is no way I can look at us losing 4 games in a row, in which we had double digit leads in 3 of them, and say we had a good season. Laughable effort and will from this team, especially Giannis. When your best player misses out on two clutch rebounds and 5 free throws, that\u2019s a fucking joke.", "Alright...

I\u2019m not gonna sit here and bash or shame anyone. I am gonna look forward to next season, and enjoy the fact they made it this far. I was expecting a different outcome in this series, but the better team won. I\u2019m only going to remember the good parts of this season not the disappointment.\n\nThe best part for my son and I was going to a game in D.C. Giannis was a late scratch, we found out 2 hours before tip off that he wasn\u2019t playing, that was a major disappointment. Before the game Brogden, Illy and Hill signed my sons 34 Jersey. Didn\u2019t see Giannis until the second quarter, then he came out of the tunnel and joined the team on the bench. My son got a high from Giannis at halftime and his other favorite Buck Thon Maker, along with the rest of the team. This is what we will remember. \n\nI hope this group of great guys can remain mostly intact. I want watch them grow, and get better, hopefully some new additions will fortify the future! \n\nThank you Bucks. I ride with you. I die with you.", "Just mad a bud for now making enough adjustments.", "Aaaaannnnd I hate sports again", "Was it just me or did Giannis pass out way too many times in his drives. Like he wouldn\u2019t try to get his shot up. I wanted I\u2019m to take more shots and force them to foul him.", "The biggest disgrace in the series was coaching, by far. Exact same tactics every game, even after 2 or 3 losses. ISO games every possession, no picks, no ball movement, double and triple teaming even my grandmother, thus leaving open 3s that even my grandfather would make. Turning a very mediocre player, Vanvleet to Curry, only you could have done this Bud. What the hell happened to you this series.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefensively, the slow feet of Lopez did not help. I love him, he really tried, but he is not a good enough defender for that level.  Even though Giannis was pretty average, he was still the best player, Khris coming second and then...basically nobody. Bledsoe, absolutely atrocious. He would have helped more if he didn't play at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing that really REALLY bothered me though were the open 3s. I mean, you know that they shoot well in the perimeter, you even lose games doing that, why the hell do you insist on double and triple teaming everyone ? Just man to man and only attempt double teams when the opposing team's time is like 5 seconds, about to expire.\n\nLike, seriously Bud, what do you expect by triple teaming in the 15 second mark ? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on what I saw this series, Giannis made Bud look a much better coach in the regular season, than what he really is.", "Regardless of the outcome. The Bucks got a new fan in me. Was a blast watching them. Been decades since I watched a full nba game.\n\nUsed to only be interested in Packer football.

I\u2019d have signed up for that. Because I\u2019d know that means this team is on the rise and has a bright future. I still believe that.", "[deleted]", "We should be proud of our team and keep looking forward. We have a budding 24 year old generational talent and this was his first real playoff run.

The end resulting is frustrating, but all my expectations were exceeded on the whole. \n\nCredit to the Raptors and their coach. If it's not us, I'm glad it's them.

Losing four in a row is just devastating.  Mirotic and Bledsoe just faded the whole series , but Bledsoe atleast  played some defense toward the end there. Seemed like every game we started strong but then couldn\u2019t adjust. And bud played it too much like the regular season. It\u2019s a do or die game in the ECF, Kawhi is out their exhausted, at some point Giannis can\u2019t be given routine rest. \n\nAlso I hate to whine, but hell I need to rant. It always seems like our team is never allowed to play as physical defense. Credit to the raptors for locking down there, and  sure, we may get away with some travels and pushoffs (Webber seems to point out every one), but Toronto\u2019s run started with a straight push from Ibaka that gave them three shots and then another two. \n\nI\u2019m sick of every time Lopez and Giannis driving , the announcers would say they traveled, and that every time Giannis shot we\u2019d get \u201cyou can live with that\u201d . I\u2019m mad that now all those idiots who the entire season were saying the bucks and Giannis were overrated will take it into the next season even though he played great and they took it to six. They were one of only three teams left but next year I can just tell we\u2019re gonna be considered underdogs to like the Celtics, again, and we won\u2019t get talked about until literally no other teams are playing. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s a victim complex but it seems like the last month this is the only place I could find that I could talk about the bucks without getting shit on as deluded, a fair weather fan, or whatever. So thanks I guess.All national media talks about is shit like.  \u201cBucks are too young\u201d. \u201cBucks exposed by the Celtics\u201d, \u201cGiannis is gonna leave\u201d, then which team Kyrie gonna join next. \n \nGuess I\u2019m gonna have to avoid r/nba for the next couple of weeks.

Every great goes through this. Look at LeBron, Dirk, MJ, Bad Boy Pistons etc. This can only help them in the long run.

Go Bucks!", "I'm sure Horst, Bud, and the FO will do their best to re-sign the FAs, draft a good player, and develop the rest of the team but IMHO by far the No. 1 priority of this organization is to pay whatever it takes to get the best shooting coach in existence (Chip Engelland from the Spurs) for Giannis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe chances of getting one of KD or Kawhi are minimal and due to our cap situation, the best way is to try and re-sign as many of our FAs as we can.

A lot of people here sound really spoiled, as if we deserved the chip this year. Idk if you just started watching the Bucks because the Packers were poor. But this year surpassed all my expectations regardless. This series was close, and two posessions really could have changed it either way.

No aggressiveness in the paint.

This was a great season and a great learning experience for the still young bucks. Problem is the raps just had more balls on em in the clutch.

And the team will need an  answer for defenses that sell out to stop him as Toronto did. The thing  that most surprises me is how terrible the Bucks offense looked at the  end of these close games. What we really need is a shooter who can  dominate. There's no way to replicate what Leonard can give you,  dangerous anywhere on the floor. I wish Middleton could be that guy.  Some games he is, but far too many he isn't. On the other hand, we  aren't realistically gonna sign someone who can do it better. Off-season  will be interesting.

And congrats to the raptors. glad they get 2 more days of rest to try and liberate the league. \n\nI think this series exposed us as understaffed in creators off the dribble. Bledsoe is not confident enough in his handle to consistently challenge defenders at the point of attack. Middleton's shot profile/passing off the dribble is not efficient enough to carry the scoring load like a prototypical #2 scorer on a title contender. \n\nThe other way we win this series next year: A lot of folks say Giannis needs to develop his three or his mid range jumper. This series proved otherwise. He can't get killed by shooting varience in the playoffs and reach his full potential. \n\nI think Giannis needs to develop a post up fadeaway move. Something simple enough where he can get hot with it, regardless of triple teams, and collapse the defense in more predictable patterns than his current attack.  \n\nAnyhow, its been a pleasure watching this season with you ladies and gents.", "Well great season lads.

Giannis was shooting jumpers, Middleton was throwing up prayers and Bledsoe just wasn't anywhere to be found. When we were up 15 why were we still having everyone collapse into the lane and leaving multiple guys open for three?? Trade layups with them at that point! The worst part is now the unknown of this off-season. Who do you keep at this point and who can you bring in? Middleton isn't worth near the max and the deal that bledsoe got, which looked great at the time, now looks like another typical Milwaukee bucks long term deal that handcuffs us.

You just can't be moving forward because you would then be impeding the offensive player.

P.J.'s not the player he once was, but he still had defensive value and clearly brought some off-court value (though that's obviously hard to quantify) to the team's overarching mentality as well.\n\nBut more importantly is the simple fact that we had his Bird rights and have limited free agency flexibility otherwise. If we could use the money saved toward other guys, I'd be totally fine with it. We can't. We're in the same place cap wise as if we kept him. He's old and might not even be worth the full price, but it didn't really matter. Worst-case scenario was he's a tradable asset. It's not a move that's going to doom our title hopes or anything like that, but bringing him back for defensive depth (especially in case of injury issues come playoff time again) given his Bird rights was a total no-brainer if trying to save the billionaires some money on their luxury tax bill wasn't part of the equation.

Maybe not big minutes, but he\u2019s going to play.", "What? At least he shows up come playoff time and would be a consistent scoring option next to Giannis", "[deleted]", "Suns you mean?", "I don't see it either. You can be shorter and still play D. Hill was noticeably the worst guy on the court when he played", "Tatum and Brown had their worst statistical nights of the series in that game. That game was an anomaly. They are on a different level now. JC wasn't going to make a difference this game.\n\nNeither JC nor GH should be playing period except for 1 or 2 minutes total.", "I agree. Idk if he should get any minutes at all either. Should be 1 minute (MAYBE) at like the start of the 2nd Q. And maybe another minute midway through the 3rd. Just to give a brief rest to the others. That's it tops. I think JC can also get that minute or two as well to give the 6 deep we have a small break. But that's it. The both of them are just in bad matchups this series.\n\nI was fuming that he got the time that he did given how much he got torched.", "[removed]", "Yup, basically a four point swing during a comeback, then that lazy rebound from Gianni\u2019s was another one.

He's a shot creator who's good off the dribble, which is clearly something the Bucks have been missing this series. Beyond just that, how many games has Kash Money won for the Bucks? My guy is the definition of clutch. If you still can't put some respect on his name after watching how much we've struggled without him this series, I'm not sure I'll ever change your opinion.

He should just stay in Utah.", "He\u2019s also starting to wash up, the better trade him while his value is still high. And what about all the times he\u2019s shot 6-19 with 5 turnovers and single-handedly lost games for the Bucks?

Millions and millions of deer people cheered for the Bucks this season. We were getting ready for a big celebration...All of a sudden it was just called off when a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of Bucks players and the fans who supported them.\n\nWe won\u2019t stand for it...We were winning everything and all of a sudden it was just called off. This is a fraud on the American basketball public. This is an embarrassment to our\u00a0sport.\u00a0\n\nWe won games we weren\u2019t expecting to win. The first Florida series, we didn\u2019t win it, we won it by a lot. We won the game we played in great state of Ohio, we won against the CROOKED BEARD in Texas\u2026It is also clear that we have won our games in Georgia.\n\nWe so clearly won. They were never gonna catch us. They can\u2019t catch us.\n\nPhoenix, we have a lot of life in that. Somebody declared victory, and maybe it will be a W when the LIAR referee points get taken away from the score, but certainly there were a lot of points out there that we could get. We\u2019re now just getting into 30 MPG territory and that could be overturned.\n\nThe Bucks were winning in all statistical measurements that matter by a tremendous amount of percents\u2014tenths, hundreths, even huge thouthands of percents. All of a sudden, I said, what happened to the season? It\u2019s off? Well, then the Bucks won.\n\nYou know what happened. I\u2019ve been saying this since the day I heard there would be just certain invited teams they wanted to lock up and control. They knew they couldn\u2019t win, so they said, let\u2019s go to Disneyworld.\n\nWe were getting ready to win the championship, frankly, we did win this championship.\n\nLast season we were leading, often solidly, in many key standings, in almost all instances L.A. run & controlled. Then, one by one, our leads started to magically disappear as surprise bubble games were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the \u201csportscasters\u201d got it completely & historically wrong!\n\nHow come every time they count Miami Heat ball-into-basket dumps they are so devastating in their percentage and power of destruction?\n\nWe want the CBA to be used in a proper manner, so we\u2019ll be going to the NBA Board of Governors. We want all recognition of bubble games as legitimate and valid to stop. We don\u2019t want them finding any bubble games at four months later in the season and adding them to the standings. We will ensure the integrity of the league.\n\nIt\u2019s a very sad moment. To me, this is a very sad moment, and we will win this. As far as I\u2019m concerned, we already have won it.\n\nEdits:\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSuch an awful governor that Pennsylvania team has now that he\u2019s calling the Bucks internet trolls! Just terrible, fake news 76ers!\n\nTWO UPDATE\n\nListen, let me tell ya, if the NBA thinks they can just now go back on the huge Wisconsin win now they\u2019re gonna be real sorry about it, because we won Wisconsin games and we\u2019re gonna get them re-played and we\u2019re still gonna win. Very mean, Adam Silver, awful guy.\n\n3 NEWS\n\nWow. amazing people over there by the Michigan team, standing up for justice and putting a stop to the crooked counting of game results from the rigged bubble! You have the champion\u2019s full support to protest as long as it takes!\n\nTHE FOURTH OF UPDATES\n\nDon\u2019t listen to the fake NBA news lies! Crooked Adam Silver trying to count more Bucks losses in Wisconsin than the amount of games actually played! Impossible! We\u2019re gonna show them we can\u2019t be beaten! Stay tuned...\n\n5FIVE\n\nThat Arizona team, all their wins are illegal games! SUNS are in space and SUNS can\u2019t even play BASKETBALL! They aren\u2019t even in America, so how could they possibly count wins for an AMERICAN basketball league?!\n\nSI6XX6\n\nCome to think of it, I\u2019ve never even met anyone from that Arizona team\u2014have you? Doubt it! Some very smart scientists just told me Arizona probably isn\u2019t even a real place! Bucks losses in Arizona won\u2019t count since the games weren\u2019t even in a state that exists!

Listen buddy, YOU CAN\u2019T COUNT THE POINTS SCORED BEFORE THE END OF GAMES IF THEY WEREN\u2019T ADDED TO THE SCORES ON THE SCOREBOARD BEFORE THE GAME ENDED! Bucks won the championship fair and square, so DEAL WIITH IT!\n\n*PRESENTLY HAPPENINGS 8*\n\nHey, listen, we can play hardball, OKAY? We\u2019re gonna sue the pants off the scoreboard operators of any games we played in Michigan AND WE\u2019LL INVESTIGATE THE SCOREBOARDS OURSELVES and let me just tell you\u2014they\u2019re HACKED! So many losers jealous of the Bucks out there but all their whining won\u2019t change the fact that the Bucks won the championship fair and square! Cry me a river!\n\n#GERMAN NO\n\nOh well LOOK AT THAT! You tried to con people by burying this, BUT IT\u2019S TOO LATE NOW! THEY CAN\u2019T UNREAD THE TRUTH! You know what? After this huge win, I don\u2019t think the Bucks will ever stop winning championships! I think they\u2019ll just talk to their friends over in the league office and the NBPA and we\u2019ll get the CBA changed to make it an official rule! The Bucks can stay atop the league winning championships for as long as they want!\n\n10TH UPDATE TIME\n\nHmmm...I\u2019ve just learned from the best advisors that MICHIGAN ISN\u2019T A REAL PLACE EITHER!

No one who has gone through the death of a family member would blame Bud for the mental lapses in the Hest series.

Bud is a good coach and he is going to get paid handsomely for the next 2 years and, let's be honest, another team would be stupid not to hire him.....so don't feel too sorry for him. Bet you he has another HC job next summer....\n\nYou have a short window in the NBA....more so than any other league because the superstar contracts are short....and it almost doesn't matter, if a star wants a trade 1 year after he signs, he basically will have his wishes granted. Winning the title was awesome....but bowing out when we literally could have had 2-3 more is an indictment of the coach. \n\nI do NOT think Nick Nurse is the answer.

I\u2019d split the fault equally.", "I appreciate Bud for taking this team to the next level and helping them establish a winning culture. I was highly critical of his strategies in the playoffs and for good reason, but he ushered in the best Bucks era since the 70's. I remember those first preseason games back in the fall of 2018 where we were ready to move on from the Kidd regime. The blue squares in the corners was a far cry from whatever Kidd was peddling in practice. It was awesome seeing every Buck take 3's, even perennial non-shooters like Flat Ass. It finally felt like there was hope that the Bucks could ascend from over a decade of mediocrity\n\nMost recently, he'll be looked at as a floor raising coach who lucked out with a generational talent that carried him in the playoffs, but history will paint him in a more positive light. 2x COTY with multiple 1 seeds, many franchise and NBA records broken, and a NBA championship, which is not something a lot of coaches have achieved. Wherever he goes next, I wish him the best of luck", "What an amazing turn around for the Bucks Org from Jason Kidd to Mike Budenholzer. I will always appreciate coach Bud. I think it was the right move if we're striving for greatness, which we are, but man did he really grow some players on our team and make them into great players. He's a great floor raiser. He could do some damage with a young talented team. I wish him the best. Coach Bud the Champ.", "I started watching games a little more religiously with Bud as coach, won't forget that dude on the sideline.", "Well if you guys hire Nick Nurse now, he will somehow find a way to play Giannis 50 minutes a game.. Even without overtime. Somehow. Good thing Giannis has magic healing powers.", "Look, he will get his contract paid out in all likelihood, unless there is a buyout. That's a pretty sweet deal (2 more years) if he needs to deal with the death of his brother.\n\nHe did a good job getting Giannis to the championship, but a championship team needs a great playoff coach on the level of Spoelstra, Popovich, or the guy who I actually think is the best ever, Larry Brown.\n\nThe thing is, Giannis is not a basketball genius, he is just a competitive max-effort physical freak. Teams like Golden State which are loaded with basketball prodigies just need a guy like Steve Kerr (who I think is an average Xs Os development coach, as seen in their tanking/down years). \n\nTeams like the Bucks? They need some real genius like Popovich. \n\nHonestly, the Bucks should try to trade for Popovich. WAIT, is Popvich's contract up?", "Surprised at all the sympathy in here. Reading comments in the post game thread after our loss y'all should be jumping for joy. \n\nPersonally i think the decision makes sense for the organization. He's proven to be a great regular season coach but has been outmatched in the playoffs too many times. Wish coach bud best of luck in the future but I think it's time to move on.", "I wish teams would take a longer view with their coaches. Bud had a rough year, probably shouldn\u2019t have even been coaching the playoff series at all given the family situation but stayed because he probably feared for his job.

I'm sure management did not expect to have to fire their coach after being the number 1 seed and setup for a deep playoff run. This was essentially the perfect storm situation that cost him his job. It's sad but from a management perspective I think it's difficult to explain running back the same group after this result. Something had to be changed and they don't have much roster flexibility so this was probably the most likely option. Bud had 5 great seasons and was a big part in bringing championship culture to the team. Also but still has 2 years on his contract so he is getting $16m I'm sure he'll be fine financially.

These issues with adjustments are things that don't even come up until you are in a playoff series against another great coach. \n\nAcross all the major sports really, the average fan tends to overrate in-game details (how can you not call a time out there?

Culture and communication matters, and that\u2019s at least a little bit of a red flag. I also would have worries about Giannnis\u2019 play style and Nurse not being afraid of big minutes in the regular season.\n\nBud also caught flak for his handling of young players, but that was a concern with Nurse too and even references by Masai Ujiri in the post-firing press conference. \u201cHard pass\u201d is probably too harsh because I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be a disaster or anything, but I\u2019d rather get Atkinson or take a flyer on an unproven assistant than go with Nurse.", "The fact that he's on the market is probably a large part of this decision to begin with.", "Raptors hiring bud would be a great choice right now for a roster rebuild.", "You really want Doc Rivers?\n\nAn assistant coach would be a better bet than a recycled coach imo.

A lot of Raps fans wanted us to tank this season but ownership refuses so he's forced to play starters if we want to try to win. The year after our championship we did great in the regular season and our starters all had balanced minutes because we still had a roster. \n\nJust wanted to say because seems the public perception has soured on him but most raps fans still thought highly of him even with his flaws and recognize that he got scapegoated at the end.

While in game you're just kinda going and adrenaline pushes through the pain. At the line it's all mechanics and his back pain seemed to be messing that up. \n\nWhich is why I think he didn't want ball because he knew he couldn't shoot them. Because Giannis has never been afraid of getting fouled.", "Oh I've been thinking about this since I read these comments.\n\nFirstly...who could even guard Shaq in the modern nba? The closest 2 I could think of are brook and Steven adams. Brook would be a max player since he is one of the few who could stretch the floor and at least try to slow Shaq. \n\nI mean Kevon looney and adebayo are considered \"bigs\" now.\n\nAlso imagine Shaq playing with the bullshit soft ass fouls they call all the time. There would have to be serious changes across the board to even offer a semblance of fair officiating. This was an issue when Shaq played in a much rougher league.it would only be amplified.\n\nIf you're gonna stretch tjem out the nba also allows zone defense now so Shaq could still protect the rim and dominate the glass and if you try to small ball them you're giving up a free dunk every possession so you better shoot like the heat did to even have a chance.", "Nah", "He's blunt and there's always going to be friction in the locker room when the team is bad.

Additionally, it felt like Nash lost the team, regardless of Kyrie or not.", "Nash is interesting. Maybe he learned from the Nets gig but idk if I would want him. He basically let the team run itself and with the guys he had I get it but it felt like he had no control and had no real voice as the coach. \n\nObviously that wouldn't be as bad working with giannis, jrue, and khris but that seems like a huge gamble. He kinda comes across as a jkidd type. Great player but it doesn't feel like it's translated to his coaching. I'd be far more interested in someone like Vogel. I think you may have converted me lol", "Nash? Super hell no. The coach we just fired coached circles around him.", "Even before he was HC he was an assistant with us for years and played a part in developing guys like Siakam and FVV.

It\u2019s quite easy to see how the calls favored the Suns at opportune times if you watched the whole game. \n\nMilwaukee was #2 in fewest fouls per game and suddenly it explodes to 26 free throws? Righttttt", "...the Bucks D is literally about switching and keeping a man back for rim defense. None of that was forced. CP3 specifically happened to hit his midrangers, but the rest of that cast was within relative expectation. My concern is with Ayton rebounding inside since the Bucks have been having problems with that all playoffs (Capela w/Hawks, Griffin w/Nets, and Ayton during the two games in the regular season).\n\nSince you're looking at the game as a product of flow (which is absolutely influenced by potential whistles for or against) and I'm looking at the game from analytics, so we're going to have different opinions on what everything means. You feel the game wasn't close. I see the rest as completely winnable given the output. Giannis was out there for 35 minutes and somehow, even with the score as it was, he had a positive +/-.  So... cheers?", "Nah. Tonight the Bucks played as bad as you implied in Game 1, and the Suns hit a ridiculous 20/40 from 3.

The revenue from that matchup would literally double what this one is giving them.\n\nThe bottom line is the losers will *always* claim the NBA is rigged. Shit, this same sub said the same thing in every series so far when we lost games. That it was rigged against us, yet somehow we won anf guess what, the teams we beat claimed it was rigged *for us*. So calling it rigged because we lost game one is a fucking joke make by a bunch of children lol. People here *really* need to grow up man. Yes, the refs sucked.

Phoenix hit 50% from 3 tonight because you had to overcommit to stopping the midrange, and it worked but their role players stepped up and hit the looks y'all were giving them.\n\nI was always just trying to say that to imply that the Suns won because of FT's in game 1 was just not what I saw.

Dude throws his body into who have their feet planted knocking them backwards on a regular basis. Do I think that should be called all the time unless it's super blatant overkill? No. But same thing with pushoffs. Unless you're like arm fully extended pushing someone on their ass then I'm not gonna complain about it. All I'm saying is I saw plenty of questionable no-calls that went the Bucks way, shit saw Cam Payne and Torrey Craig get knocked onto their backs without a whistle. It goes both ways. \n\nLet's put it this way, I simply don't think the refs are what lost you the game. It was the terrible defense switching mismatchs onto CP3 and Book all night which is what they love to abuse more than anything, and the fact that the Suns actually made their FTs helps too. \n\nI have nothing against the Bucks. I've had nothing but respect for Giannis, K Middy, and you fans. I rooted for you guys as my main team the past 2 playoffs. I like you guys and I hope the games are called fair and the best team wins. I'm just not gonna sit here and pretend that I think the calls were completely one-sided like Bucks fans are making it out to be, unless I truly agree with it. I saw some Bucks fans posting single frame screenshots of \"fouls\" on K Middy and one was where a defender caught hand when it was considered part of the ball, another was where a defener go a clean strip and caught wrist afterwards.... so eh. \n\nThat said, perspective is everything and I understand that it's different when you're watching from the other end of it... I'm gonna not see some bad no calls that happened against you guys and you're not gonna see some of the no calls that went against us. That's just how it is. Everything always looks different when you're watching from the other side.", "[deleted]", "lol you know when someone keeps reciting tired cliches they got nothin.

It's fine if the refs want to call soft fouls, but it needs to go both ways. There were instances in which Khris immediately drew contact right after we had a weak foul called against us. It's painfully obvious when the refs swallow their whistles like that with no consistency. Middleton had the highest points/shots? in Finals history without a FT attempted. That's insanely significant, and unbelievably historical given the rules in favor offense and all the rulings around jump shots too. If it comes down to a 1 game series, it will obviously stick out for those who watched. It's also just plain bad for the sport. Seems like lots of casuals are really turned off by flopping and foul baiting. Kind of embarassing to see that in game 1 of the finals, especially since I think this could be a classic match up and its two teams who have struggled to get to the finals for years and were not favored", "Difference is Giannis regularly get some offensive foul called on him... not booker\n\nThere is never one thing that make you lose a game, most of the time it's the sum of many small (or big) things. But you are right we could have play better, we could have adapted better in defense, we missed few easy buckets,... the team is, hopefully, focusing on those things they can improve.\n\nI think the frustation come from the fact that :\n1- when we were doing some good run the Suns were able to stay alive thanks to those free throws\n2- Looking at very similar drives from Kriss and Booker, one get the fouls but not the other\n\nBut you are probably right, the calls were not one sided and looking it from a fan perspective might be biased.  \n\nWe also have to give credit to the Suns, they are a great team and they play well.", "Crowder and Ayton can\u2019t keep their feet set watch them catch a pass, travel, but of course you wouldn\u2019t want the NBA to call that. \n\nPayne actually got one carry called on him, must\u2019ve been a first but every time he dribbles he does it. \n\nMost of Giannis fouls are offensive lol they actually reward the defense for flopping like Booker does on offense!", "I, in fact, won\u2019t fuck off.

That being said, no way in hell we would have gotten past Lakers and Clippers without doing some of it because both LA teams live on it.

I think it\u2019s the right change but under current rules, what CP3 does is smart.", "Sorry if I came off as a dick btw for coming in your guys sub and disagreeing btw. I'm not trying to become public enemy #1 with Bucks fans so I'm gonna stop and see myself out(deleting my arguments I started). Unfortunately we're forced to be enemies rn and I'm letting myself get sucked into playing the enemy role too much. But I just shouldn't have even said anything esp since it's your guys own sub.\n\nUltimately this is more than likely both of our first times seeing our teams in the Finals and I gotta remember emotions are gonna run high on both sides as we both want this bad. I just gotta learn to let it go and remember that sometimes I feel the same way. Sometimes I feel like refs questionable calls killed the Suns momentum and stuff like that as well, so I just gotta try to be more understanding and put myself in your guys shoes instead of getting sucked into saying things that I know will just cause shit-talking wars, against a team I have nothing against. It's not like in the Lakers or Clippers series where there are legitimate reasons for me to hate those teams and get into arguments with.\n\nI wish we could both walk away with a chip. Shit, I'm the type of person who wishes everyone could live to see their favorite sports team win at least 1 title. But you know how it is. It's win or go home. That's just the situation we're in. No matter what happens I hope the Suns/Bucks could turn into a long lasting \"friendly\" rivalry in the future. We both built our teams a similar way, went through struggles and were forced to mostly through the draft with a young core because no free agents with a damn were jumping at a chance to sign with us. So we can relate in that aspect, and feel like we both \"earned\" our merits as fans to get to watch our teams finally have this success.

The bucks played foolish and looked like they didn't belong. They didn't have that fight. That killer instinct they finally got during title run where they could close out a team when they finally had to. Bud is a fraud and has been exposed. I expect he will be canned because bucks don't have much roster flexibility", "Lowry is good at leading our offense, but really kept all his gas for the post season. And as you saw, it wasn\u2019t a ton of gas. Bam is fine, but he\u2019s inconsistent as hell. Oladipo was better on defense. Thank god for Jimmy because we had zero playmakers before point Bam after Herro went down.", "Oh the team looked like shit, but I still think it's stupid 67% of the league makes the playoffs.\n\nLegitimately could have rested the starters for the final 2 months and still made the playoffs easily.", "Giannis had an interesting quote about the heat playing to win and the bucks playing for a championship. Meaning the Bucks were just assuming victory in the 1st round and never put any urgency into it like the heat did.", "You literally can't give effort on drop coverage.  You're hoping the opponent shoots average or below on long 2's. That's it. That's all.", "Yeah man. Try reading my whole comment.", "Most Raptors fans I heard said the only reason he worked them to the bone was because they never had a good enough bench. Basically whenever he tried to give the starters regular starter minutes they would get smacked. Then the GM would try to fix the issues to the same results. One of the reasons he left the Raptors.", "Lowry is 40 years old and the heat really paid him 25M per year. That\u2019s crazy, especially when DR is on that huge contract and had his minutes taken by a guy on a min deal", "I get your point to a degree, but I feel that's akin to slipping on a banana peel because you wanted to walk with your eyes closed, and then blaming Big Banana for selling fruit in your area.", "I don't get that though because this was elimination game. Maybe it got them to that point but how do they choke again in a must win game. In order to play for the championship they have to actually get there. I can see messing around early in the series if that's what they actually did but when it got 3-1 that mindset had to change. I think they just couldn't flip the switch because they weren't in cutthroat mode earlier. Their desperation play looked pathetic. They get ahead and then choke it away with bad execution and foolish shot selection. Bud let's it all happen. He's going to get canned.", "Yes that's been a constant theme over the bud years but my point is it wasn't *just* that, the overall effort level was pathetic and the team completely unprepared overall. As I said, they looked like playing regular season games.", "Nurse got fired, he didn\u2019t leave (although he was considering it).\n\nNurse is pretty bad at developing young players but is fantastic with a ready made championship roster. He\u2019s an excellent tactician aka X\u2019s and O\u2019s Coach, his weakness is in developing players and building strong relationships, he\u2019s not really a players coach but for a championship level roster he\u2019d be perfect, like he was for the raptors in his first year. He\u2019d be great for the bucks.", "[deleted]", "Yup! That\u2019s pretty much how it goes. Some coaches are better developers and some are the types that you have when you are competing for championships.\n\nthere\u2019s only a few coaches that can do both at a high level."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

Nothing else matters.", "It really only works if it keeps Giannis in Milwaukee. Otherwise we really are crippled.

Whenever they play against each other, it's obvious how much personal competition is between the 2. He's a legit shut-down defender. Absolutely filthy on that end of the floor. He's going to guard Jimmy if you face Miami in the playoffs and he'll make Jimmy pay for every point scored. On the other end, any wall built will be highly ineffective because of his penetration. If there's a wall, simply send Giannis to the right post on the play, Bogdan, Middleton, and Brook can't all be cold at the same time, Jrue will drive to his left and draw attention every single time.", "why", "i feel very good rn", "Better in every way on offense and about the same type of player on defense", "Considering the circumstances, such as previous mistakes from ownership and the FO, the Bucks had their backs against the wall here.

This outcome is a whole lot better than trying to run it back with more or less the same roster (aside from FA's and the guys who declined their PO) and with draft picks (guaranteed late 1st rounds) that won't move the needle either.\n\nThere's still a chance that Giannis doesn't sign the supermax anyway and we just have him for this year, but this is a risk you take with a generational talent on your team.

One who engages in this fallacy is said to be \"attacking a straw man\". The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., \"stand up a straw man\") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument (\"knock down a straw man\") instead of the opponent's proposition. Straw man arguments have been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly regarding highly charged emotional subjects.\n\n[About Me](https://www.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) - [Opt out](https://www.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) - OP can reply '!delete' to delete", "I feel like people are ignoring the fact that he was terrible in the bubble and was a large part of our issues in the playoffs. \n\n2 years ago he was amazing Bledsoe insurance.

Doing that all game, is very tiring.\n\nI am willing to bet, him settling for a 3 or mid range at times, is him being tired and trying to score in a less energy zapping way. He can't just put his head down and drive every single play... He pretty much always does that, but he will occasionally take a jumper to catch his breath.\n\n\nAlso, there is no way to get better at shooting, unless if you actively do it during a game. If Giannis never shot jumpers, then it would show he is scared to improve and try to get better outside his comfort zone (cough cough Ben Simmons),  so I am fine with him taking a few jumpers a game.", "In the regular season, let him take 10, who cares, they'll make the playoffs anyway. In the playoffs, he needs to be smart on his shot selection. He's like 15% from 3 this post season, which hurts the team. Same thing could be said about Jrue. He's had some terrible games where his shot selection is disgusting. He's making games closer than they have to be because he's going 1/9 on 3s", "Pretty sure the general hope was that he would develop a serviceable 3 point shot...not clank a bunch of threes. \n\nNow...I'm happy with how gjannis has kept it to a couple a game...in fact I think it's worth the momentum the team gets if he makes one of them..\n\nBut I don't thunk anyone was clamoring for him to clank 9 threes per game like he did early in the Brooklyn series.", "It was a bad take back then and it's a bad take now. He's not averaging 30 per game by jacking up 3s. 2-5 attempts is fine but not in crunch time or close games. I'd like to see more midrange shots though. Jumping straight to 3s just seems overly ambitious in the ECF.", "[deleted]", "People also need to learn that attacking the lane constantly is tiring. I dont mind him shooting a few jumpers. Nobody is telling him to be a volume shooter anyway.", "> Yeah, the missed one was an airball, but a miss is a miss.\n\nDisagree, if you aren't even close it's time to stop shooting", "Still shouldn\u2019t take them", "He's always the top reply on a lot of sports tweets and the amount of people who think he's like, a real legit serious person will never not be funny to me.", "barry is a legend", "that would be absolutely horrible for the pups. Bring you dog to anything is terrible especially if its solely on leash", "it's already \"traumatize your pet with unnecessary noise\" week\n\ncan we not?", "this tweet is offensive tbh", "This is very VERY right. I think the coaching staff should focus mostly on his stamina and NOT his shooting.", "This is part of the reason he takes so long at the ft line too. He uses is at a mini timeout to catch breath and his long routine is part of that process to mask it", "He can pass the ball to someone else then, instead of shooting long 2s or 3s. \n\nI prefer he don't shoot. The zero three attempt game was fire", "His passing seems fine...\n\nHis team mates gotta hit more shots", "If your 3pt% is 50%, you better keep shooting even if you airball 5 attempts.", "You\u2019re right bc an air ball is functionally not the same as a miss. A miss gives your team a chance for a rebound.", "Oh yeah, that\u2019s obvious", "Yeah, it would definitely be sensory overload for them.  I dig it when they do the Bark At The Park nights for baseball though.  A bit more of a calm atmosphere.", "I think the coaching staff should focus on his post game so he can grind out points when he wants/needs to take over a game. If the drive isn't there he can kick it out and get into the post, receive a pass again and go to work, if help arrives he can find the open man. Mans a 7ft athletic freak of nature, we're letting teams off the hook not forcing them to defend down low and it would create more space for Middleton and Jrue to get it going", "I see what you are saying, but there have been times in the post season where the entire team is cold or not moving around off ball, and Giannis settles for a jumper because I don't think he has any other option. Not saying this is always the case, as he does take some early shot clock 3s, but I have seen a lot of his jumpers be a last resort thing.\n\nAlso, I don't think it is a bad thing for him to take 1-2 3s a game, and a few mid range shots. Imagine telling young LeBron to never shoot and just drive every play? To this day, LeBron is still a pretty streaky shooter, but he is much better than he once was. I think Giannis can eventually one day become a streaky shooter who has a few good shooting days and a few bad shooting days. He is never going to be elite at shooting, but if he can at least develop a decent mid range shot/post fade, then that will add an entirely new dimension to his game imo.", "His teammates would probably get better looks if Giannis could hit them right in the shooting pocket. That's not necessarily a weakness in his game but definitely something he could improve upon.", "OK, but Giannis is not a 50% shooter and your sample size is two. If he shoots an airball from 3 it's time to stop.", "It seems like especially in the Nets series he was posting up quite a bit, like full on back to the basket, and a lot of times the defender would disrupt his dribble and the ball would end up on the floor or Giannis would kind of panic and scramble to retain possession. Definitely something to work on in the offseason.", "Just do a little dream shake", "That's why i said IF. In the more normal case when he goes 1/3 or 1/4, he should stop. But the airball is irrelevant.", "Yea but part of having a good post game is not dribble excessively. You get the ball and make moves without moving your pivot, then 0-2 dribbles and you go up.", "Right. Again, something I hope he develops maybe this offseason."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

They just have to have not entered the Free Agent market in the past three years.

Nearly every team exceeds the soft cap, Dallas is the only one under this year, and only a few teams go into the luxury tax, six this season, GS, OKC, TOR, POR, BOS, MIA.", "Total newbie here, but if they sign Niko and Brook first, can they exceed the cap with both Brogdon and Khris cuz of Bird and RFA and go into the tax?", "I think Brogdon will be the hardest, other than Lopez because the bucks have no rights to him.  Brogdon has such high aspirations outside of basketball that I could see him taking as much as he can get so he can go make a difference in the world later", "We are clearly better than the raptors though.

When Wade was hurt in 2013-2014, it didn't matter that they had peak LeBron James & Chris Bosh. Wade was hobbled and wasn't himself, leading to a 1-4 series loss to the Spurs.\n\nIf you are investing your salary cap in a few players, you don't have enough money for depth. That's the GM / Front Office's fault.\n\nYou also accept the risk that they might not play well together. The recent one I can think of are the Clippers. The 3 biggest stars to fail are probably Barkley, Olajuwon, and Pippen all on the Rockets in '99.\n\nEDIT: For what its worth, I don't consider the Golden State a superteam.

If KD was interested in coming to MKE we would entertain that, the same way he wanted to join the Warriors. \n\nI really hate the teams that are shitty in a big destination market...and then acquire three guys and expect to win.

Super teams are so good because, even if two of your stars get injured, you are still able to be competitive with the best team in the league.

Whether you call it luck or not, some players seem to miss more time than others. That's a fact. The Nets invested 75 million dollars a year in two of the more injury-prone players in the NBA.

I may not like a joke about my mother but i have to be mature enough to understand the importance of anything being subjected to ridicule.  Most people that have an issue with a subject being made fun of have their own internal issues that they have with that particular subject, they are trying to virtue signal to gain points from the offended group, or they are narcissists that cant handle being made the subject of ridicule.

Humour is a great way to deal with issues that are painful to us, and can be a great outlet. There is however a big difference between humour we use to alleviate pain and understand ourselves (cathartic/ pathos humour), and exploitation humour which just seeks to ridicule others for our own amusement. This type of humour is selfish and lacking in empathy, and doesn\u2019t seek to delve into our own human condition. It merely operates as a device to derive self pleasure at the expense and pain of others.\n\n\n Trolls may think they are hilarious, but they usually seek pain in the misfortune of others and seek to cause further pain to derive humour. While technically you can consider this type of trolling as \u201chumour\u201d, it has no real benefit to humanity other than to the troll themself. \n\n  There are many examples of dark humour that help us laugh at our fears and say fuck you to the world as a way of finding some sense in this absurd world. Mocking and exploiting the pain of others for our personal amusement doesn\u2019t really achieve this at all, it just uses others pain as a way of finding a cheap laugh.\n\n", "Cant police jokes. I think you need to reexamine the context of this joke and remove your bias (philly fan). No one is the authority of jokes.

It shows that you have no empathetic compulsion to understand the pain or beliefs of others, just tell everyone else to \u2018get on your level because you\u2019re not mature like me\u2019.  Society won\u2019t send you to prison for exercising your right to free speech.

I hope we meet in the next round (bucks in six!) and it\u2019s a great series. I didn\u2019t mean to get into a giant discussion about humour, everyone has their own sense of humour and it\u2019s usually fine. \n\n  I just take exception when children are currently being massacred and horrific things are being done right now to people that we can actually help, and we instead laugh at their plight. One of my friends escaped from Sudan, his family is currently being persecuted. It\u2019s no fuckin joke there right now, and humour is the last thing on my mind when I want to help innocent people being persecuted. IMO laugh at nazis, morons, hell any politician and jerk that deserves it. Be as crude as you want it\u2019s all fair game. \n\n  It\u2019s when we trivialise the current tragic events of the day, that help us to be numb to the urgency of helping our fellow innocent persecuted men and women, this does nothing but drug us into a stupor and renders us powerless to fight for the good in this world.\n\nAgain, not policing anything, I stand by you and all humanities right to be as vulgar and hate filled as they want to be.  Just calling for a little bit of humanity in the midst of a crisis, no one has to listen, but I will always stand up for my values at least "], "CommentLinkTitles": []}
