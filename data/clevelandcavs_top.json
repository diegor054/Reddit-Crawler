I bet he's happy he did it without Pat too.", "**HAPPY FATHERS DAY LEBRON**", "Oh hi front page of Reddit, fancy seeing you here", "So, I'm a little late to post on this thread, but I was spending some QT with my fiance watching the Battle of the Bastards. \n\n\nHowever, if anyone reads this, I'm not a CLE fan, nor a GS fan. However, I can't *stand* bandwagon fans. I hope there is a special place, that's extra hot for them when they move on from this life. With that being said, this championship run by the Cavs was especially satisfying for me for several reasons:\n\n\n1) Fuck those that are suddenly (were) GS fans, unless you're from the Bay. No one was a GS fan before 2 years ago, unless you're from the Bay. I live in southern California, and it makes me so pissed when I see people down here rooting for them. These are the same people who's Laker flags suddenly disappeared. Yet, to hear people cheering when Curry makes a long 3, and say, \"We are such a good team, no one can stop us...\" Give me a break. I'm also a bartender, and nothing would please me more than to criticize them across the bar for being a phony Laker fan, let alone a Warrior fan. \n\n\n2) What LeBron has accomplished is truly historic. The guy takes a middling to terrible team to the finals, averages a triple-double nearly the entire playoffs, but loses in the finals (CLE before MIA). Then he leaves, the team returns to absolute garbage, nearly overnight. He returns, they immediately return to competitive levels. He barely loses to a team of snipers in a sport typically fought with close combat. Then he faces them a consecutive year, after that opponent breaks the single season win record, (losing 9 times in 8 months). Overcomes a 3-1 deficit to force a game 7, which had never been done, and then wins.  I mean, WTF?! Yes, LeBron is clearly losing his effectiveness as a scorer as he ages, unless he learns to be better shooter, but he is the undeniable common thread to CLE being a Finals team since he's been in the league. Even if LeBron never wins again in CLE, he is going straight to the Hall after this. Ironically enough, his departure from CLE, leaving it in flames, only to create it's glory, makes his legacy that much better. Yes, it was sour grapes for many who weren't even basketball fans. But goddam, there's no more denying his legacy. He didn't just win. He didn't just beat a team that had it all come together for a year, and then fall apart. I admit, I thought they were done after game 4. I made the reference, that unless Curt Schilling knows how to play basketball, they're done. However, the rest is history. People who can't articulate why they hate something or someone, and have simply joined the masses, irk the ever-living crap out of me, because they're just another lemming. So Lebron and the Cavs, relish in this moment. You are the reason we love sports so much. Group achievement is such a unifying event. Lebron's tears were pure joy, relief, and love. Much props my dude. \n\n\n3) Fans of Cleveland sports, residents of Cleveland, residents of Ohio, or Ohio natives, nothing but heartfelt applause from me. You are the quintessential example of tough Americans, who work hard, and are loyal. You deserve this. Americans love the underdog, and we love hope. It's moments like these that make me fall in love with being an American all over again. Yes, it's just a sport. But, it's also a reflection of people's aspirations.\n\n\n\"Sport can create hope where once there was only despair. It is more powerful than governments in breaking down racial barriers. It laughs in the face of all types of discrimination.\"            -Nelson Mandela\n\n ", "I can't stop crying, I'm so happy ", "WON ONE FOR THE FUCKING LAND", "BELIEVELAND!!!", "I can't fucking believe it.\n\nI can't.", "Guy from Buffalo here.

Enjoy it guys, you earned it!", "I'VE WANTED LEBRON TO WIN EVER SINCE HE CAME BACK TO CLEVELAND BUT I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT HE WOULD ACTUALLY DO IT!!!! YES!", "There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.\n\nIt occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.\n\nI was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.\n\nJust to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.\n\nWe listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: \"November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.\"\n\nNow the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \" Houston Center voice.\" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.\n\nJust moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. \"I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed.\" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. \"Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check\". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: \"Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.\"\n\nAnd I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.\n\nSomewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: \"Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?\" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. \"Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.\"\n\nI think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: \"Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.\"\n\nFor a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, \"Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.\"\n\nIt all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.\n\nFor just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.\n", "Yes!!!! We did it!!!

I've always wanted to be like you. Play ball like you, I always had all your gear and merchandise. Wore your shoes, had all your jersey. I still remember the day you came up to me and signed your jersey for me. I remember it exactly honestly. I arrived at the Q, I was a but early and you were shooting around with a few other players. My dad took me down to the lower levels courtside seats and see if we could get your attention. I yelled your name out a few times. You saw me, and you walked on over with that smile and signed my jersey of yours and whipped a joke whilst doing so. I was so happy and excited, you legit made a 9 year old's day!  \n\nEven off the court, you are such a wonderful person. You're a phenomenal dad, a rocking husband of your wonderful wife/high school sweetheart, a great friend as well. You make sure the kids in Akron and NE Ohio are educated and you help them out ($35M for a school, holy fuck!). You are very well spoken and opinated. You are a man that I, a 20 year old man, still look up to as an inspiration. \n\nI don't care what happens, I don't care if LeBron never wins a ring again, LEBRON JAMES IS MY GOAT!

What I mean by that is not just his greatness as a basketball player, but what he brings to the game of basketball. The epitome of a role model. I've said it before and I'll say it again, if the worst thing in your career is going on live TV announcing you've signed with another team *while* donating money for charity, man that's pretty damn good. What a great ambassador for the game LeBron is. ", "Prolly no one wants to hear this long text but hey I figure this will be buried anyway.\n\nLebron means a lot to me. When i first really started paying attention to him a few years ago, I had just graduated college. I was kinda down in my life. All my other friends had gone to medical school and I didn't have the grades to get in. I felt like a nothing and a no one. I was retaking my MCats cause they sucked, and wondering what the point of everything was.\n\nThat's part of why I kinda loved the Cavs, at that time. They were the underdogs, the scrappy guys who were never supposed to be in the finals, never supposed to win but they did. Unlike GSW, they didn't have perfect ball movement and beautiful screens. They didn't wear gold shiny uniforms. They wore wine and gold. Instead of KLay, we had JR, a reformed bad boy, and resident sharpshooter. Instead of Shaun Livingston, we had Richard Jefferson. Instead of Klay, we had Channing Frye, a previous bballer with a heart condition who was slowly making it back to the NBA. Instead of Steph, who came from a two parent family, with a basketball\\-er dad; we had Lebron. He was our MVP, was a man who had not received league MVP despite putting impressive numbers, a boy who grew up in a single parent home in the wrong part of town, and who carried the weight of who he was on his shoulders no matter where he went.Which is to say that our team was like a cast of misfits, that finally found a way to make it good.\n\nAnd we played like ass. All the time. Some of the time. Sometimes one would get so frustrated watching the Cavs in the middle of the season, defensive lapses, going 2/20 on 3 or whatever. Sometimes Kyrie would dribble the ball into a death spiral and declare the earth was flat. Klove would disappear from games and the planet at times.And it was likely we were a lottery team.\n\nBut when it worked. When JR would shoot from anywhere on the floor. During the Atlanta Hawks game, when we rained hellfire from 3, there was only one word for what the Cavs could do.\n\n\\*Sublime\\*.\n\nAnd I loved that, the roughness around the edges, the scrappy ness, the Cavs were uniquely as human as I was, as imperfect as I was. I could look on TV and see people who I related to in a way I could never relate to GSW.\n\nWatching Lebron struggle through these last few years has taught me a lot. it taught me to have faith, no matter what when i was panicking with every lost game. Taught me to be steady and hold the course. It taught me that \"nothing is given, everything is earned\". Watching basketball game me hope back in those days. Watching Lebron ball has been a gift, but what I have truly loved about him was his dedication to himself as a father and a man of the community. It is why I look up to him and why he is my favorite basketball player.\n\nIt's been 2 years now, and I'm in my second year of medical school, a place where I thought I would never be. But one of my favorite ever moments has always been driving down my local road that year I got into med school, right after the Cavs won, and seeing the sun hit the road at such an angle, and feeling hope, that my life was all open in front of me like a never ending road.\n\nThe cavs team taught me a lot over this last 2 years, but most of all, they gave me hope during a year when I didn't have any.\n\nI will miss Lebron suiting up in a Cavs jersey, but I could never be angry with him. I'm just grateful for everything.\n\nThank you to the Cavs team, and thank you so much Lebron.\n\nIt might just have been basketball but it meant so much to me.", "Any Ohioan who doesn\u2019t appreciate this man is an idiot.

I am content and wouldn't mind if he goes somewhere to get some championships that **he deserves**. He delivered on his promise and I'll root for him wherever he goes.

I wouldn't blame him for going somewhere to give him a better chance of winning a championship.\n\nLebron...thank you.

I'll have memories to share for the rest of my life about the amazing plays you made, the game winners, the unstoppable 50+ point performances that I can share for the next generation.  **And you were a class act while you did all of this.** Sure, the decision felt like a bit of a betrayal, but you were younger then and needed a taste of what it takes to be champion. I thank you for bringing that back to CLE and giving us what we've needed.\n\nI'll never forget the memories, and I thank you for giving me, my friends, the city of Cleveland, and the state of Ohio one hell of a ride. This one's for you!", "I'm emotional and critical of this man at times but he is the best basketball player ever and an even better role model and human. \n\nThank you LeBron James.

I fell in love with the Spurs in 2013, had my heart broken. In 2014, I gloated and celebrated at LeBron\u2019s loss. \n\nThen he came home, which we didn\u2019t expect. \n\nIn 2015, we were decimated by freak injuries against a new, exciting Warriors team. And he left it all on the floor with a ragtag team of nobodies and went down swinging (and I\u2019ve outgrown my Delly shirt). \n\n2016, LeBron delivered on his promise. He broke the Cleveland curse against all odds. Unanimous MVP, 73-9 team, down 3-1 in the finals, and he won it. \n\n2017, Kevin Durant sucks. \n\n2018, this year. We lost Kyrie Irving, traded for what panned out to be dead weight. LeBron dragged this team, at some times seemingly against their will, into the finals. \nHe never gave up on us, and did everything he possibly could. We weren\u2019t supposed to even be there- if you listened to the talking heads it was Pacers in 6, Raptors in 5, Celtics sweep. And we got there. \n\nAll of this is to say, LeBron James, you gotta go where you\u2019re gonna win. This isn\u2019t 2010 again, this won\u2019t be Miami.

I said: \"he's just an athlete.\" Then he kept improving and I said: \"but he doesn't have a jump shot.\" Then he kept improving his shot and now it's more than respectable: it's dangerous.

Kobe couldn't keep my interest because if you're only looking to get your shot, then you need the \"it\" factor to keep my interest, something Iverson and definitely Jordan brought to the sport. then out of nowhere a swell of hate started swirling around a teen from Akron, I knew I had to take a closer look. As the hate grew disguised in jealously, the more the teen drew people to him and the closer I began looking at his game, and that's when I said to myself, this guy gets. Unlike the versatile QB's in the NFL their game is evolving and when they've evolved I'll be right there to watch the product(if the NFL get its act together by then). \n\nHe could score 40pts every game yet decided to score less while getting others involved. Defending and rebounding, this teen is how I envisioned my ideal basketball player would approach the game. My only concern was, would his game translate to the NBA. A few years in, his play convinced me he would be the greatest to ever play the game, and He has not disappointed.\n\nMany will say he's on the final chapter of his NBA career, yet I believe he's on the final third of a book with pages yet to be written. It all depends on the team and importantly the coach, the Chosen One chooses to help carry his legacy across the finish line. However before breaking the tape I need him to wipe the smiles off the faces of the warriors. \n\nFrom a teen who devastated people by forgoing his college education(it had nothing to do with the 100mil he signed with Nike), to a teen making national news for a parking-lot fender bender to the decision, which I had no issues with. Those who haven't fully forgiven him for the decision, newsflash, they hated him before the decision, and they're grateful for the decision because it gave them something tangible to attach to their irrational hate, to the 3-1 comeback and possible the greatest series in NBA history by a team and individual player. He has and continues to give us highlights game by game while many simply hope for 10 great highlights in their NBA career. then again what do you expect from a man whose mother named him LRJ, some people call him bron, others.... The Chosen One, or The King. Although I want to call him hall of famer, I known I cannot until he's officially inducted. Until then I will only to call him, goat, was there ever a doubt Lebron Raymone James would be called anything else.

Seriously, if you have ever done any betting on the NBA, you\u2019ll see real quickly that there is something real fishy about the outcomes on games based on the spread. I bet on the NBA for about a half a season many year ago and stopped when I got this strong suspicion that the officials and players new the spreads and would manipulate the games outcome in the final minutes. \n\nIf you want to play the \u201cVegas won this game for GSW\u201d game, you have every right to. People that bet on the Cavs had the most money to win.  Meaning Vegas and the sports books had the most to lose. The spread was Cavs +12.5 at most sportsbooks. The most important part is the money line bet. If you were to bet the Cavs to win straight up, your average payout was between 6-7.5:1 depending on when you place your bet. Meaning if you dropped $100 on the Cavs to win straight up, without the points, you would win $600-$750. \n\nWhen you put this all together and you like to feed into the conspiracy that the NBA could possibly be controlled by Vegas...you have the final 2 minutes of the game where it becomes obvious the Cavs are going to cover their spread. Then you go into the last minute where it starts to get obvious that the LeBron is taking control and can taste an upset. If you\u2019re Vegas, you don\u2019t like that because you have a lot of money at stake. And let\u2019s be real, any smart gambler doesn\u2019t bet against LeBron with the season he is having. So there were probably far more bets made on the Cavs for the higher payout vs the Warriors 1:9 payout on the money line. Meaning that Vegas and the sports books aren\u2019t getting the return from the other side of the bet to break even. \n\nWhat does that get you?

Cleveland is near the top right and Cincy is near the bottom left.  This leads to a natural division of the state.  They are about a 4.5 hour drive from one another so they aren\u2019t particularly close.\n\nI\u2019d say generally people divide Ohio in 5 areas and that\u2019s how they identify themselves.

Not to mention a lot of shit ((outside of their control) happened after the cavs went down 3-1 that enabled them to come back. \n\n> And I\u2019m willing I bet 2011 Mavs don\u2019t beat the 73-9 warriors from a 1-3 deficit.\n\nAre you arguing that the Mavs weren't as good as the Cavs? no shit.

That right there should discredit anything you ever say. Dude has done so much for the city, more than probably any single other person have. Second, you saying \"he won once in 11 tries\" and act like that's a bad thing. Championships aren't easy to win. It's a miracle he ended up winning one anyway given who it was against. Yet you don't appreciate that. Without him you have ZERO, that's right count it, championships, and would still be wearing a brown bag over your head.  Then again about the loyalty, Lebron again has done more for Cleveland than be a basketball star, and he has spent the majority of his career here anyway. As you saw by where he went, the Lakers, he clearly has other life goals in plan. And lastly of course, cheering for his second round exit just makes you a douchebag. It's fine if you don't want to root FOR him, but unless you have severe mental disabilities, there's zero reason to root AGAINST him. So there, hope you were able to get this far.

Good luck Kevin, my favorite player from the championship days.", "I'm still shocked that he was with the Cavs so long. Especially after constant trade rumors and claims that he didn't fit in.

I think the writing was just on the wall that it was his last year here regardless.\n\n100% he'll get his number retired here, and it's well deserved.  Thanks for everything, Kevin.", "I\u2019m shocked and so upset to see him leave. The Cavs should\u2019ve fought for him to get minutes.

For being the \u201cquiet guy\u201d he sure loves drama, but I\u2019ll still be grateful for everything he brought to this franchise.

Either way, thanks for all the good times Kevin.", "Man this one hurts a lot.", "No. Stop. He's my favorite player of all time. It can't end like this.", "This hurts somehow. I was really hoping for him to ride it out with the new squad. Injuries suck.\n\nThank you Kev. Still amaze to see you cling with Curry on the final seconds of game 7. Thank you for the Championship.", "Love d\u2019ing up Steph at the end of Game 7 was as important a play in that game as LeBron\u2019s block and Kyrie\u2019s shot.", "Welp\u2026 I guess the only silver lining to being at that fucking Warriors game a month ago was that I got to see him play one time in a Cavs uniform", "I will always love this man. I\u2019m not big into idolizing or looking up to athletes but with K Love it was different. His transparency about his panic attack episodes is something that actually really helped me come to terms with my own panic attacks. It\u2019s a hard thing to come to terms with because of how real and physical the symptoms are. \n\nBut hearing Kevin talk about his episode was one of the most relatable things and honestly brought me to tears. It really helped me learn to accept that this is a part of my life. I seriously wish I could somehow thank him but I\u2019ll just leave it here in the hopes that JA is lurking on this thread and relays it to him lol. But seriously thank you Kevin love for all the years, the stop, the championship and so much more. This one hurts", "really sucks, was hoping to see us get a restructure done for a couple more years.  Still have hope we get a 1 day (or maybe a vet min next year) to get that retirement and jersey in the rafters.", "it\u2019s a sad day :((( end of an era. I hope he gets what he wants and does well on a new team", "we kinda screwed him over by signing him promising we'd be a win now team. then selling everything forcing him to rebuild with us. the man when we are good we are so good that we can't justifiably play him right now. he gave us so much and in return we kinda robbed him of a good chunk of his career. hope he finds success and consistent minutes.", "I still can't believe it's ending like this.", "Why though?? He was the piece we needed and never played this year.", " Bye Kev \ud83d\ude22", "People on here always talk about how he was bad for the locker room during this and that and whatever. How he wasn't a team player and just did his own thing blah blah blah. The guy was LITERALLY in trade rumors from November 2014 til now. LITERALLY. Never demanded a trade or cried about it like Kyrie. Just went out and performed. Every pro athlete has their blow ups we just don't see 99% of them because we're at home with our dicks in our hands pretending like we know what's really going on. Love was a great teammate and I guarantee every young player on this team the last 4 years would say the same. Even Sexton lol. He's still a GREAT rebounder and once he is fully healed I guarantee he goes back to shooting 35+% from 3. He was shooting 40% before he got hurt and the people who are pretending that wasn't true are turd nuggets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho's the new silver fox on the team??? Luke Walton? lol", "I love KLove!  So sad to see him go!  \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\ud83c\udfc0  Thanks for everything!!!", "Wait, what happened??", "Really glad LeBron stepped in and didn't let in be remembered as \"The D\"", "Fairly certain that both are locks.", "I admire your passion", "It must be this wasn't rest for injury but he was going into a James Jones or Udonis role where literally all he does is sit. I imagine he just wants to play.", "Honestly I love Kevin but unfortunately he wasn't ok with riding the bench and being out of the rotation. I was hoping he would at least stay for the upcoming playoff run to be a mentor and be there just in case the right situation presented itself to play. The Cavs wanted this I really think so but Kevin wants to play.", "I don't think Love could play SG.... you can't compare two players at different positions....", "I mean, when Lebron left, Kevin just got stuck alone on some crap team and basically instantly forgotten. Cleveland may be on the rise now but they won't be contending in a time frame that has Love actually playing for another title. Maybe he can still contribute for another couple seasons on a contender and get another ring. In my opinion, he should have gotten out right away when Lebron abandoned the franchise to obscurity. I feel like he wasted the 2nd half of his prime :c", "Unfortunately, I don't think he has enough seasons in him to still be around by the time you guys are contenders. I'd like to see him get another ring. The Warriors need a big man", "Wade & Windker are early in the careers, let\u2019s give them a chance. LeVert is adapting to a new role and has been doing ok all things considered. I think JB could do somewhat better with game management. Relying on four guys to play all your minutes will not win you a championship. The team has depth but the younger players need rotations. In my humble opinion, if JB is going to sometimes use Wade instead of Okoro, he need to let Wade play with the starting four more. Also, let Rubio and Levert head up an entire bench unit and get these guys used to playing with one another. There are too many hodgepodge/visceral decisions being made that are contributing to bench players and Okoro running around aimlessly.", "He\u2019s not, he\u2019s supposedly going to the Heat", "What drama has he been involved in the last 4+ years besides the blow up the year after LeBron left? The fuck are you talking about?", "Agreed to a contract buyout and will likely sign to a new team", "he's goin to miami", "He has always been emotional. He's been hurt and apparently had a blow up with Koby. He thinks he still can play but he's basically been benched since mid January. He's a shell of his former self.  Like he's making like 28 million and couldn't even get bench minutes on a team with bad depth. JB is a defensive guy Love is by far the worst defensive player on the team. His thumb injury prevented his one good asset of being a catch and shot.", "Wait huh\ud83d\ude2d", "If he can find his shooting touch again, he's still certainly an NBA caliber player who can provide some offense and rebounding off the bench, even on a good team.  But his defense really took a dive this year, and it obviously wasn't his strong suit to begin with (which is putting it mildly).\n\nI also think he probably realizes that, even if he realistically can still play at a decent level this year, he doesn't have many years left as a player who merits legitimate minutes.  Wanting to actually play in what might be the last (or second to last) season of which he can actually provide value isn't outrageous at all.", "The Cavs are closer to contention than the Warriors", "Windler has shown literally nothing in 3 years lmao.", "Calling out sexton to the media, blowing up at Altman in his office, turning over the ball on purpose in a game, sitting out entire seasons for toe injury when we were bad, getting kicked off team USA, and ultimately requested off a playoff team lol quite a lot actually", "nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo", "Agreed or in talks?", "To join LeBron James once again?", "Shooting 40% from 3 until he got hurt.

HaS aLwAyS bEeN eMoTiOnAl", "At the championship parade, David Griffin was giving a speech and was saying something to the effect of how Cleveland will never forget The Block, The Shot, and The D. Lebron and K-Love started laughing as soon as he said The D and when LeBron talked next, he very quickly emphasized that it's The Block, The Shot, and The Stop", "I didn't realize this was the Cavs subreddit when I posted, thought it was just nba lol. Sorry but that's just objectively false. The Warriors are literally the reigning champions. The Cavs may have some young and upcoming talent but they haven't been relevant since the second KD signed with the warriors.", "This Warriors team is not the team that won last year, that should be obvious. Even when healthy, they haven\u2019t been anything more than above average. The Cavs comfortably have a top-2 Net Rating and are top-10 on both sides of the floor, a well-known recipe for success. The Warriors aren\u2019t top-10 in either, and are barely positive in Net Rating. The Warriors are a .500 team, the Cavs are 15 games above that. It\u2019s okay to be biased against them, but to say that Warriors are objectively closer to contention is objectively false, you need to think less about the past and more about this season and beyond. The Cavs have a higher likelihood of winning the title this season, and the gap only gets bigger as the years go by.", "While I think your point is definetly valid, I disagree with the Cavs not being relevant since KD went to the warriors.\nEven a team that is far below the warriors but made the finals isn\u2019t irrelevant, I would imagine Indy, Toronto, and Boston in 2018 didn\u2019t find them irrelevant", "[removed]", "We\u2019re on track to have a home series and you\u2019re on track to be in the play-in.

The point the guy was saying that Kevin Love is still under contract and could have easily stayed half a year. Lebron left in free agency both times. \n\nBut to argue against the other guy. Kevin Love needs to get minutes in order to get a new contract. Plus he doesn\u2019t have many years left and wants to contribute if he thinks he can. So you can\u2019t blame him for leaving or even call it disrespectful", "i mean...when lebron left the first time people called him a lot worse than an unprofessional grifter, so this kinda does follow that logic. the 2nd time was after a title and 4 trips to the finals where he was arguably the best player in all 4, not to mention he played his ass off through the entirety of his contracts each time (ok fine, he took some games off, but never ones that mattered).\n\nthe issue with love is that he signed a huge contract and by the 2nd season he was telling reporters that he didn't want to be here, as [windy reported here](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2870059-windhorst-kevin-love-absolutely-wants-trade-not-much-traction-toward-deal). he then had the sexton trash talk, the throwing the ball to the other team, the tantrums, etc. and after having a season of being the good guy/bench guy/veteran presence, he basically decided once again that he doesn't actually want to be here. it's not that he's a villain and should be reviled, but he's not exactly a hero either.", "I just don\u2019t know what true pro means then. Typically people use it to describe someone who\u2019s professionalism doesn\u2019t wax or wane based on their situation. This would not describe either Lebron or Love.

I root for the team, not individual players.", "Right back at ya, friend!", "This may sound crazy or it may not. I don\u2019t think LeBron leaves without one.

He can do two different things. ", "That\u2019s the right standpoint. Gilbert fucked Cleveland over. He showed Griffin the door, when Griff was trying to find an avenue to acquire PG or someone else for Kyrie. \n\nConsider the fact that Isaiah Thomas and Jae Crowder aren\u2019t even in Cleveland anymore and Gilbert practically LET Kyrie walk. \n\nRegardless of whatever LeBron may have done wrong or Kyrie may have felt, Gilbert, with his one ring, got tired of paying for a championship team and said fuck it. ", "Lebron also had one foot out the door the entire time he was here and got us to sign all these stupid ass contracts", "He did.

Wasn\u2019t til we played them that I knew they were unstoppable. ", "Were not talking about stars were talking about players like JR Smith, TT. Cleveland isnt a literal trash dump, those players are replaceable and we can get better ones for cheaper. ", "Funny enough, we beat them in that first meeting. It was Christmas, RJ was dunking on fools, it was great", "I pretty much had the same thoughts and reactions as you during that whole time so very understandable.\n\nI just don't like the inaccuracy when people in this sub say \"LeBron only gave us 1+1 deals\" and \"LeBron got a Championship in Cleveland and left as soon as he could\" because he totally signed a 2+1 deal in the 2016 off-season. His last season with us is the only one I would MAYBE agree he seemed like he had one foot out the door", "On a LeBron-less team, maybe. On a team with LeBron that was the best option to maximize your chances of more rings. ", "Tristan was not replaceable after what he did in that finals. So sick of that narrative, Cavs were keeping Tristan regardless of what LeBron wanted.", "Players like JR and TT who were instrumental in the Cavs winning a championship? Show some respect ", "Oh, agreed. I have my issues with how LeBron spent his second stint here that are largely the same as other people\u2019s (kind of forcing bad contracts on the organization in order to hook up his friends, not being transparent with his free agency plans last year and letting us flounder, etc.). \n\nBut the dude brought us a championship - he\u2019ll forever be my favorite athlete for that reason alone. \n\nI think there\u2019s a lot of middle ground between blaming Lebron for where we are now and not having any issue whatsoever with how he left. \n\nI also just fucking hate that he went to the Lakers of all teams, but I can\u2019t really hold that against him.

Lebron is a shitty player GM and he should have let Griffin do his job.", "Pretty sure we were over the salary cap, what vet min player is going to replace TT even semi competently.

No one doubts lebron's longevity, but Jordan accomplished so much more in fewer games played, which is more impressive. \n\nAnd if we're talking about per game stats, then it's much closer. Lebron leads assists, rebounds, and blocks, Jordan leads point,  steals, and turnovers. \n\nAnd like I said, if we're looking at box score stats then Jordan had a higher career PER than lebron in both regular season and playoffs (highest in NBA history actually). \n\nHe also has a better win shares/48 than lebron in both regular season and playoffs (again he has the highest in NBA history)", "> but Jordan accomplished so much more in fewer games played, which is more impressive.\n\nIs it though? I'd say it's far more impressive to come out and perform at the highest levels, night after night over a longer period. Not to mention context. Jordan didn't have to face the Warriors. Or league changing in play style. Lebron has adapted incredibly to changing strategies. Or even the criticism Lebron has had to face. Lebron has been shit on consistently throughout his entire career.", "Jordan still faced all time great teams. Jordan also faced a much harder eastern conference than lebron did.\n\nAnd yes, when we're talking about that they've achieved, we the fact that Jordan accomplished WAY more despite playing a few less seasons is a testament to him being the GOAT.\n\nHe was just flat out more dominant. \n\n>  I'd say it's far more impressive to come out and perform at the highest levels, night after night over a longer period\n\nExcept Jordan played at an even higher level. And its not like he had a short career, he still played over a decade.\n\n12 years of Jordan's production is worth more to a team than 16 years of lebron's production (in terms of on the court value)", "Competition was so weak back then when coach Phil Jackson left the bulls he came to L.A with kobe and shak they won 3 nba finals in a row. Jordan never made finals without Phil Jackson. Even if jordan didn\u2019t retired bulls would have no chance against those lakers. Jordan never made playoffs with the wizards. Never eliminated larry birds celtics in playoffs.  never faced a team with 73-9 league record in finals which the warriors set. Never faced a 5 all star team like 2018 warriors . A team with coach popovich San Antonio Spurs with 5 rings. Lebron face the same teams for 7 finals which is only two teams . Both a dynasty team. 2018 Lebron alone forced the cavs into the finals breaking allen iverson record with the most 40 points games. Best playoffs performance in history. You can go back to any performance in history and none are better than Lebrons .  2016 finals greatest performance in finals and comeback against warriors best team league record. 2018 finals no performance is better than Lebrons game 1 finals 51 points against a 5 all star team. The game keeps evolving and players are more talented. Rusell wesbrook break records averaging triple double a season. James harden 32 games in a row with 30 points games. Wilt chamberlain has that record. Steph curry only player in history with 400 plus 3s a season is the greatest shooter of all time. LeBron James already surpassed jordan in most points , assists, rebounds in playoffs and finals. Only player in history with 32k points 8k assists 8k rebounds.

The time for rebuild is over for the Cavs with the boom of DG and JA. Also, as Mobley gets better, there is no reason to hang on to these picks. We were the second seed last year prior to injuries, and judging how Sexton would come back this season (and also need to get paid) it'd be stupid to prioritize him + low first-round picks rather than getting Donovan fucking Mitchell.

I wonder if 2 bigs like that would just dominate the glass so much that teams wouldnt go small like they did against the Jazz.", "That's a rookie #.

Same as Russell", "It\u2019s insane how their careers here have so many parallels. Right down to the messy-ish departure regarding contracts and being traded for a divisive(huuuuge gulf of course) player.", "The problem I have with it is we still need a legit starting wing and we no longer have the assets to get a very good one. Okoro is at his best as a guard defender rather than wing defender too even if he does improve to being a starting level player. Levert ain\u2019t it and has no potential and is also not true wing sized.", "5 FRPs is *always* worth something. Giving up that many picks severely limits the Cavs flexibility going forward.

A consolidation move was bound to happen eventually. May of just happened sooner than people expected, but you never know when the opportunity would of arose again.", "\u201cNope\u201d is not a real answer lol there is still a spectrum of how much better Mitchell will be than sexton vs how much we gave up, and until we\u2019re seeing the actual physical results of the trade this season we won\u2019t know. Acting otherwise is naive. If Ochai looks like a young star and sexton is putting up high volume and efficient scoring stats in Utah, while we struggle not having a true wing(missing Lauri) and Mitchell isn\u2019t enough to even win us a playoff series\u2026the trades gonna look real bad lol.", "Well Mitchell isn\u2019t a top 10 player so\u2026and we don\u2019t know the true potential of sexton/Ochai yet either. I\u2019m excited about the trade but there\u2019s certainly variables out there giving me some pause", "Brunson got paid this year because Mitchell defense made him look like all star.

Are you saying there\u2019s no correlation between offensive rating and the top offensive weapon on the team? \n\nIf you\u2019re so positive that Sexton is so closely comparable to Mitchell, then why was Mitchell\u2019s trade market so much more robust than Sexton\u2019s? Apparently you know more than all the other NBA franchises.", "We never had the assets to get one. A quality starting wing in the NBA is more valuable than a franchise QB in the NFL.", "Aren\u2019t two pick swaps? If what I\u2019m gathering Utah will get the higher which will likely be theirs so we keep at least 2 firsts? Idk I\u2019m not sure at all but from a quick glance there seems to only be a downside for unexpected windfalls or downfalls or teams near each other. For teams that will be in the tank race and a team picking outside lottery then wouldn\u2019t we just keep ours?", "Well there\u2019s always one way to get a pretty familiar face at small forward \ud83d\udc51", "It's worse than a lateral move if you factor in the picks. \"Not to be that guy\" but you don't understand team building and asset value if you don't understand how we lost this trade. Look, it might work out because we have a talented roster but that doesn't mean this was an efficient use of our resources.\n\nEdit: Can't reply to the chain because I was blocked so:\n\n\"Know what you get\", \"win now mode\", \"aggressive move\".\n\nThese are all terms I hear fans use that usually describe supporting moves that bring back negative value. When competing against 29 other teams all trying to get better, the only way for a front office to consistently come out on top is to consistently win in value. There's a lot of luck involved too so it's not impossible that this move works out for us even if we lost the deal on paper but that doesn't make it a smart move.\n\nMitchell is better than Sexton but it will be tough to ever argue we won the trade in he's putting up a few more ppg on similar efficiency considering we gave up 4 1st round picks (including this year's rookie).", "Now that I'm past my knee jerk reaction, I'm mostly upset with them getting another small sg and getting rid of LM. Who made us taller but wasn't really part of the core. I see how Mitchell makes us better offensively. It's obvious how much this makes us better on that end. The issue is defense. We now are a lot smaller. And Mobley and Allen can't help if the other 3 guys are being shot over all game. We went from upper tier defense and moderate offense to upper tier offense to moderate defense   and less depth.", "Really shortsighted. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s some lock for a finals deal but choosing those dudes over Mitchell in the playoffs is insane", "He\u2019s also old with no upside.", "I just don\u2019t think people know enough about cap and roster rules to evaluate trades the way front offices do. Even if there was no trade, Cavs would have to cut a player just to re-sign sexton! There were always going to be players getting released/traded in the few months leading up to the season, and landing a star while trimming the roster (and solving the Sexton issue) is huge.", "while \"we can't possibly no until after the season and technically not until that '29 pick matures\" is technically the correct answer, i kind of figured we were doing some speculation based on what we perceive today.  in which case is Mitchell Lauri+Ochai+4 picks worth better?... nope he is not.", "That\u2019s 10 deep but definitely need a 3 and D guy now", "Theres an elbow for that dont worry", "Roty \ud83d\ude02", "[removed]", "Just stop lol. It\u2019s pretty easy to see that between sexton/Lauri/Ochai/Okoro/Levert/5 1sts we could\u2019ve traded for a wing, instead we have Okoro/Levert/2 1sts left which isn\u2019t getting us much", "The pick swaps are meaningless as Utah would not execute a swap with the Cavs who have a worse pick.", "Didn\u2019t he just sign a pretty lengthy extension with LA?", "I think too many people overvalue an asset's worth. A pick's value is based on their potential, not on their actual value. At least you know what you get in Donovan.", "3 late first rounders and 2 pick swaps that won't be executed. Mitchell is a fringe All NBA guy. You're a lunatic.", "4 first round picks that will be worth what if the Cavs are contending..?", "Believe it or not, Mitchell came into the NBA known for his defense under Pitino. Somewhere along the way, he's given up on that end, but maybe with the right coaching they can bring it back out of him. Mitchell may only be 6'2, but his wingspan is 6'10 and he obviously has elite athleticism. The tools are there for him to be a good perimeter defender", "He\u2019s 22\u2026 I know that may be \u201cold\u201d for a rookie but he definitely has upside. Lillard was 23 years old when he was drafted.", "It's 3 picks, not 4. They will all be late first rounders amounting to nothing. Pick swaps won't convey. Mitchell is a top 15 player. Do the math.", "Praying for Ice\u2019s shot to develop \ud83d\ude4f", "What happened to okoro??", "Only way raptors can stop him is being dirty.", "Trae young", "Do you think a team could be good having Conley and Bogi as their 1st and 2nd scoring option?", "You guys got Mitchell.

Hopefully JB can find a way to harness that defensive potential.", "I think we could get him to buy in on that end now that he sees a long-term vision with elite players a similar age to him, and also has Evan who can come out to the perimeter and help while Fro protects the rim.", "He has no ball handling skills we drafted him because we need a 3 and some d type player that\u2019s his best case scenario to become that kind of role player. And old rookies succeed way less.", "i was copying and pasting from the user I responded to\n\nyou're correct it is 3 picks, and the swaps likely don't convey\n\nI stand by my answer with the corrected numbers though", "No 3 as of now.", "And embiid injured Scottie barnes, Thad, khem and his own teamate", "[removed]", "He shoots above league average no??", "Yes you can?

They just wouldn\u2019t. \n\nThey also don\u2019t have 5+ players averaging 15+ points. They had 4, counting Mitchell, so really only 3 others.\n\nGobert is a defensive specialist who\u2019s mostly a lob threat and P&R finisher (both things that are elevated by a creator like Mitchell), Clarkson was a solid sixth man averaging 16 points against mostly other back ups, and Bogi was a solid scorer for a 2nd option.", "They\u2019re not average compared to the entire NBA, they\u2019re average compared to 2nd, 3rd, and 4th option scorers. \n\nNever said they were bums. Gobert is an elite player, though not much of an offensive creator. He\u2019s a role player offensively, not a go to option.

Kyrie is no doubt one of the 4 or 5 best point guards in the NBA but please don\u2019t be a part of the masses that puts flashiness ahead of actual value and two way impact. Kyrie is above Draymond of course but undoubtedly behind their three best players. And before you go at Klay, that dude would be incredible as a strong 2nd option somewhere else, he just has the second and third best players in the NBA on his team. He also eats Kyrie\u2019s lunch every time he gets the switch.

DWade probably cares and so does CBosh, Miami fans care, so why wouldn't the Warriors fans care about those KD rings?

He had to get through the Boston Celtics who had KG, Ray Ray, Rondo, Pierce. He didn't gut the entire Eastern Conference by joining the Celtics, which is what KD did when he left the Thunder. Why do you think KD is even considering leaving the Warriors if \"banners are banners\"? Why not just stay and rack up chips? Even the players on your team understand what I'm talking about, and it shows in KD's lack of commitment to Golden State beyond this season. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "I have no worries about KD leaving tbh.

Heh. \n", "That\u2019s cool. I think you\u2019re soft for coming to the Cavs sub to talk shit when your team has won 3 titles in 4 years. Does the 3-1 thing really bother you that much? The irony of this in light of klays recent butthurt is fucking amazing. Glad the greatest comeback in nba history is still fresh in your mind. ", "3-1 really was a fun ride, interesting to see how it got turned around.  It tore apart Cleveland with Kyrie bailing out due to the toxicity of the LeBron effect, IT unable to play, GM getting shown the front door, Blatt/TLue firing and LeBron leaving for another journey. That\u2019s a helluva ride.  But you guys got that banner which is nice and good memories from it. \n\nGood luck in the draft, I like Sexton he seems like a keeper but everything else seems really shaky. Might want to trade KLove and get a draft pick, no sense in him going down with the ship also. \n\n\nI just was bored and wanted to stroll down memory lane with y\u2019all.

To be fair, I'm probably just upset about last night and am taking it out on the city, and the teams in general, but I'm nearing the end of my patience.

Don't let his mistake distract from the real issue in game 1, which was the refs consistently swinging momentum in GSW's favor with no calls and reversing the charge.  In the replay you can see LeBron calling a timeout with ~2 seconds left and get ignored.  Besides, if KD doesn't get those free throws then Cavs are up 2 and JR is the hero for not letting GSW get a last second 3pt attempt.

Cerebral players, the Tim Duncans, the Tony Parkers, the Jason Kidds of the world adjust their game to compensate for their declining physical abilities by becoming mental masters of the sport. They may not be the force they once were, but they will be productive and efficient.

If they at least get a decent shot up and it misses, they would have kept fighting into OT in my opinion. ", "so that makes his dumb play ok? Cool. And dude, watch the play. Lebron was screaming at him for a while. I dont think you know what immediately means..", "Yeah because everyone forgot about him choking like a Boston Celtic on that free throw. ", "They do the same thing for TT as well. I'm scratching my head reading these comments.", "Agreed. Yeah it's awesome that he helped us win a ship, but we shouldn't be complacent with just one. We have a home town hero who's a potential GOAT trying to win Cleveland more championship's. There is already a good chance he leaves, and with what JR did last night there is a really good chance he just pissed away LeBron being in a Cavs jersey next year. He shouldn't get a pass", "We probably could have done it with an alternate piece.. but we'll never know", "And he\u2019s going to be critical piece of this year\u2019s runner up.", "Both of them played great defense yes, I just felt like whenever Clarkson got the ball on offense he'd go into tunnel vision mode again. There were so many times there were guys open in the corner and he'd settle for a contested fadeaway J. However, I do feel these guys are not a lost cause, these guys are known microwaves and once they get their shot going it's bbq chicken for us.", "I think the quality of shots and movement of the ball is why JR is getting a *slight* pass. Clarkson was/has been forcing shots that have no business of being attempted by anyone, and once again, has ZERO assists. That kind of offensive play is inexcusable.", "Probably because jr has accomplished something with this team, and clarkson hasn't done anything. YET. I feel bad for my fellow Peenoise Clarkson doe because everyone expects him to perform well cus there's a guy who scores 30+ points per game. ", "This is smart. Green has a bunch of Ts already. Go after him and get more. ", "because years ago he did a good thing. Dont you remember", "....but he blew the game winning play (just as much as GH blew it). I dont know how you can just shrug that off, but whatever it's over", "He is too terrible to hurt his confidence ", "Everytime i tried to drive it was a complete mess", "It's so funny  to see the give him a pass post all ready lol", "Completely agree. It kills me that JR got confused about the score while Hill was shooting free throws. Not during some crazy sequence when they were up and down the court, running or defending fast breaks. During FT's you have a few seconds to breathe, think, and understand the situation. ", "Exactly. The only reason I'm slightly mad is that once he grabbed the board, if he hypothetically thought they were up, he should've passed it to BRON! JR is like a 70% free throw shooter... No court awareness during the most critical point in the game. ", "I love you both", "He's the scapegoat to take the heat off of the biased officiating.  If the refs didn't get involved to influence the game then the cavs are up by 2 when he gets that rebound.  Probably more with the absurd amount of no calls the cavs got when getting hacked and held  by GSW inside.", "The refs screwed you guys over. Let's get the straight. But the game wasn't over, even with that charge. G Hill is the one to blame, period. He's getting a pass because the JR play was more TV bait, but Hill lost this game", "The real story.  The only time a live bet was available with the Warriors as underdogs was in the last minute of the game and then Tony Brothers, a ref investigated by the FBI for spread manipulation, reversed the call to a block...", "This is a cop out tho man. He had a rebound and had a chance. He blew the chance. No one is saying he 100% would have made it, but hell he 75% could have. KD may have fouled, he may have airballed it. We'll never know. But saying he didn't have a free basket doesn't = a bonehead play is ok", "100% yes. It seems that everyone was reacting to what he was doing/were in so much shock that they didn't think of just using the timeout", "You\u2019re going to give JC more minutes than JR Smith bc of one play? Thank god you aren\u2019t the coach", "You better get used to keep\nForgiving him then", "Completely agree. ", "really c'mon", "Nope fuck you ", "No, looking back, it was better that the cavs lost in the regulation than having to play extra 5 minutes dejected by the blunder and by the poor officiating.\n\nJR should have just tossed the ball towards the ring, hope for the best, and give his teammates a chance to rebound or tip in.\n\nHowever, hindsight is 20\\-20 and what\\-ifs won't help moving forward. Cavs in 6!", "Yeah this crushed any confidence JR had. It would of been 10000x times better to lose on a last second shot then to have JR lose all his confidence and the team get blasted in OT", "This is exactly what I was thinking, if the warriors had gotten it they had a timeout and thats a scary thing ", "That is some flawed logic? He cost them a chance to win because he has the lowest basketball IQ in the entire NBA.", "Remember 2015? We lost Game 1 in OT but was able to take Game 2. That team was so thin and didn't have any gas left in the tank in Games 5 and 6, but hopefully this series will start similarly and end differently.", "next game is that game", "Yeah but we can usually count on Korver to put up more then 3.", "The Cavs won't have to rely on Lebron as long as everyone else contributes. Remember that there were some games this postseason where Lebron didn't score >40 points and they still won because nearly everyone contributed. Although Lebron getting his GOAT statline may help the Cavs win the game, the Cavs need to focus on making the right decisions on both ends of the floor as well as landing their shots. So, if Kevin Love, JR Smith, George Hill, Jeff Green, etc. can all keep up with defense while also making their 3 point shots (which was below average last night), the Cavs may be able to win.", "I would've said that a couple weeks ago, but I'm not so sure now. Certainly a feat of Hercules", "Draymond Green has one of the most punchable faces ", "Oh well yeah I'm with you there, but I know the NBA won't throw their men under the bus. \nAs far as Draymond, he's trash. He'll get his soon enough", "Probably for energy, honestly. My friend did point out and I finally agreed that Korver is a defense liability. But Clarkson wasn't shooting well even though he had better defense. It's a lose lose I think", "No because defense is a thing. ", "They need to take Clarkson's minutes, not JR's...", "Calderon will get smoked on D.  Cedi is too inexperienced, but I'd like to experiment with him", "It looked like an accident. High intensity play. Same thing with Tatum last series. Some people wanted that reviewed too but at the end of the day it was players playing. Also, it was inconsequential so everyone was able to walk away ", "his foot slipped, replay is clear.", "[deleted]", "Yeah someone pointed out that they stole game 2 in 2015 after losing Kyrie in game 1. That is way more demoralizing than what happened last night. ", "he's talking about 2016 game 7", "Right. It is much better to be up one with 4.7 seconds left to play, than to face a home team with 3 shooting specialists in OT after handful of terrible calls.", "I agree that's the best scenario. Given these scenarios:\n\n1. Hill makes free throw, Dubs with chance to win with 5 seconds\n2. JR rebound, contested shot in the paint\n3. JR rebound, kick out to Bron for shot with 2~3 seconds\n\nPersonally I would put all 3 scenarios favoring the Warriors.", "Refs swallow their whistle on last second plays. I wouldn\u2019t trust JR to make a shot there.", "He could have scored or gotten the foul.", "I didn't say it makes it okay. But it was an understandable and forgivable mistake that he attempted to rectify **immediately.** There was 4.3 seconds on the clock and he managed to pass the ball and there was a shot attempt before the time ran out.\n\nI watch nearly every Cavs game and have the last 4 years. \n\nI don't think you have ever played sports before if you can't understand what happened and forgive him for it. ", "I wasn't even mad at JR. He hussled all game, got some important rebounds, got in the Warriors heads a bit and played well for the most part I thought.\n\nThat George Hill. I can't believe the guy. I'm sure he's had his moments but he can't seem to hit crap when the game is close.", "enjoy the boston smack talk while you still can lol", "Doesn't matter. JR is the piece we had, and he showed the fuck up then. Doesn't excuse yesterday, but I stand by what I said.", "Yo man I get that it was a deflating loss, but it's still just 1 game. Nothing is set in stone.", "Exactly. My friend group and I have watched all of the Cavs playoffs games together so far and it's a pretty sure bet between us that when Clarkson gets the ball on offense that he's trying to score. \n\nTo the point where he doesn't pass it to open hands and he tries to play iso and put up a mediocre shot. Happens imo like 85% of the time. ", "Clarkson shot 3 3pointers yesterday and 2 of them were open shots. ", "I mean we're assuming we get a good shot off and it goes in, his blunder was catastrophic but might not have even changed the outcome. The refs outright changed the outcome. ", "\u201cI know he lost the series for us, but remember 2016 brah?\u201d What a joke ", "I don\u2019t think it was a 75% chance. I think that is an easy, routine block for KD. Yeah it was dumb, but if he goes up and gets blocked and the Warriors get the ball with 3 seconds, that is considered a dumb play too. I think we should\u2019ve called a play and drawn something up for LeBron to get the last shot. ", "OFC not, if I was the coach he would be benched much earlier in the season, just as Clarkson. JR plays one good game and 15 horrible games. For sure he's putting Cleveland down (not alone), but his share in this situation is not small.\n", "This is what I was telling people at the office all day. Would have rather lost on a dagger than shit officiating and a clumsy situation. ", "Why does everyone keep referencing 2015?!?!?!?  I do believe we lost that series in 6 games?!?!?!?!?!?", "Kevin Durant is the difference between then and now.", "[deleted]", ">Remember that there were some games this postseason where Lebron didn't score \\>40 points and they still won because nearly everyone contributed. \n\nThe Pacers, Raptors, and Celts are not the Warriors.. ", "JR going to the bench really handicaps our spacing tho. Hill-Bron-Green-Love-Thompson is a helluva big line up hahaha, it'd be a sight to see, just not in the finals. I think we keep JR in the starting position, despite his late game cluster, he was doing a good job on defense and I can credit him that much.", "No he won't.  For 4 straight years now he has gotten away with virtually anything and everything.  He should have twice as many technicals to his name and already been suspended by now.  Gouging LeBron's eye are you fucking kidding me?\n\nI remember in 2015 the atrocious amounts of moving screen calls the Warriors got in their favor.  I remember having a small conspiracy in my head that these refs/Silver/*someone* has a lot of money keeping championships from the lone contender from MJ's GOAT status.  \n\nIt's not a conspiracy I have much weight behind or even fully believe.  But if something came out 10-15 years from now about this I wouldn't be shocked in the slightest.  They get away with so much dogshit garbage it feels like I'm watching something pre-determined in real time sometimes.", "What's funny though is that Clarkson is also a defensive liability... and an offensive one. \n\nAt least Korver is intelligent and plays with effort on D.

Well, it seems Klay now has an injury (a sprain) that he played through instead of resting, which would have been the normal course of action in a regular season game.\n\nI just don't understand the dichotomy of fans. Are you not upset about Draymond's hit on Lebron? People want to crucify him. On all accounts it was also inconsequential as Lebron finished with 50 points and almost steals the game!\n\nThat kind of \"high intensity play\" is exactly what is criticized of Draymond, but ignored in the case of JR.", "I hope you give the benefit of the doubt to Green, Zaza, Durant, or any other Warrior who commits a similar foul.", "As I said, if this had been Zaza Pachulia, or another Warrior, I just want people to say the same. I bet in that case people would be killing them. Like that fall that Zaza had over Westbrook. People immediately said it was done on purpose.

I legit dont know people who haven't played a sport before, so I dont even know how that's your go to.\n\n I know exactly what happened, he was playing scenarios in his head and pictured what would happen if they were in the lead. But he's a professional. There is no situation where he would get a rebound and be in the lead. So I have no clue wtf he was thinking.  This isn't the regular season or even a regular playoff game, it's the damn finals. \n\nHe didn't pass it immediately. Unless you think 4 seconds, aka enough time to nearly run to half court, is immediate. They even got the shot off with 0 seconds on the clock. He saw lebron but thought, since they were ahead in his mind, they GS would be fouling (this is why the argument that he should have called a timeout is pointless, he thought they were up). So he figured it would be a bad play to pass it and risk a turnover.\n\nLook dude play mental gymnastics to excuse it all you want, it was a stupid ass play which washed down a great game from LB. It's over, nothing will change that, so whatever.", "And he is something like an 80% ft shooter. ", "Why are you in a Cavs Reddit go away", "I'm not giving the refs a pass.

KD did nothing wrong.", "Why even bother posting that?", "And? It doesn't mean that the Warriors can't lose.\n\nSure, if all their players get hot then winning is difficult, but the Cavs have to try their best to match them when that happens or get hot when it doesn't.

Should have backed off deep, knowing Livingston is no threat from range. \n\nHe's not *that* intelligent of a defender.  Know the personnel.", "Clarkson had some good plays and hustle on D, I remember one steal vividly. ", "It's contextual man. There's no answer applicable to all situations. Assess each on its own merit. JR's foot clearly slipped, it's very apparent. Some of GS's players dirty looking plays have been questionable, some have been accidents. One must assess each individually.", "When it involves the first pro sports championship in a generation, it\u2019s not a bad crutch to lean on.", "Not a crutch at all. \"What have you done for me lately?\" HELPED BRING A CHAMPIONSHIP TO CLEVELAND AFTER 52 YEAR DROUGHT. Miserable cunt.\n", "The defense he has played this post season has not gone unnoticed but he needs to make some shots.", "As per usual you are incorrect. \n\nHe was also the best 3 pt shooter of any starter on last year's finals too and defended well also\n\nIt's not just about 2016 to Anyone who has a clue at all", "You were being a dick to me so I was being a dick back. \n\nIt was a stupid ass play. It did not wash down a great game. That is my point. JR is taking heat unfairly when there were so many worse things that occurred. ", "Maybe you should watch the interview.  JR say he knew they were up but that he would have been able to finish over 7'6 wingspan KD.  Yeah he should have passed to LeBron, but that wouldn't have been an issue if the refs let LeBron call the timeout he signaled with 1.5 left on the clock.  That's part of playing a team sport, you have your teammates backs and don't throw them under the bus for on mistake.  Every cavs member could have done something, making an open three, making a free throw, calling a timeout.  When you play a sport where everyone's contributions lead to the final result you can't cast the blame on an individual.  Besides, whenever Tony Brothers is officiating you should look to the point spread in Vegas instead of the players on the court.", "like to see what other teams are up too", "And by the time JR gets up KD is back in position. He has a 7\u20190+ wingspan and can block a 2 guard without jumping even. And I was saying if JR went up for it and KD blocked him and gave them a chance, people would be calling that silly instead of using the timeout and getting something designed", "[deleted]", "I never meant to suggest giving up.. it's just a shame to see that performance by The King wasted. I was only saying that games vs those Eastern teams are not the same animal. If LeBron has a great game and goes for 35 we will still need like 2 guys to have Jeff Green game 6\\-7 vs Celts\\-type showings.\n\nI'm begging Kevin Love to find his confidence versus these Warriors and start going off on the offense end. Look he played some impressive man\\-defense last night but we need MIN\\-era Kevin Love aggression. I would rather feed Kev in the post and let him rain down threes as much as he wants to somehow find that confidence. At this point it seems like a better option than hoping one of these other guys catch fire for multiple games", "Ah yea I remember that play. I think it was miscommunication. I forgive Korver much more than Clarkson bc he makes up for it on offensive. ", "Me too but one steal doesn\u2019t make up for all his other mistakes. ", "Very well, you sound rational.", "Let me report you first. JR won us that championship? He was a blip on the map. We let Delly go, traded away Kyrie Irving, Shumpert, Frye. BUT we couldn\u2019t do it without JR Smith. Our savior. ", "The only reason JR Smith is a Cleveland Cavalier is because he\u2019s not that good and makes too much money. Otherwise he would have been out the door. ", "Then tell me the numbers of the starting PG\u2019s and SG\u2019s in the playoffs. WOW JR Smith is... below average. ", "Might be near the bottom. ", "Where is JR this year? Nowhere to be found. ", "They lost, so it did. No matter how you look at it, they was the opportunity.

He ran to fucking half court. Don't play dumb man, you're not\n\nYou're acting like i dont think the cavs got screwed. They did. But there were so many shit calls. But having a \"we love jr he did nothing wrong\" post is ridiculous ", "Ok so then call a timeout. My point is that he blew the chance. He thought they were up. He could have gone up for a layup, passed it out, got space and took a shot, called a timeout. He somehow wasn't aware and just blew it.

Thank you.", "Report me because you got cussed out in a sports sub? A C.U.N.T. that's what you are being. JR did not win that championship, but he was part of it and he made big shots.. did you even watch it?", "I literally had a nightmare last night about basketball and I woke up today as pissed as I went to bed ", "No, he's not without a significant share of the blame.  He should go up regardless of who is in front of him, and should have called a timeout.  But the other coaches and players should have too.  LeBron actually did call a timeout with ~1.5 left on the clock but it went unacknowledged.\n\nBy half court do you mean to the top of the arc? He went towards LeBron.  I can make just as compelling of an argument that he was trying to hand it off to LeBron for a last second shot.  This really comes down to being a good teammate.  Yeah, JR fucked up, but he still was having a positive impact on the game up until that point.  Why would you throw your teammate under the bus when it's only one game in a best of 7?  Have him motivated rather than dejected.  ", "Agreed here. And i don\u2019t think George is \u201cgetting the biggest pass of all time.\u201d He missed a free throw. People miss free throws. That\u2019s understandable. He averages 4 of 5 made. Not knowing the situation late in a finals game isn\u2019t understandable. JR doesn\u2019t get a pass, but he doesn\u2019t deserve as much hate as he\u2019s getting", "You can\u2019t even understand basic reading fundamentals. What have you done for me lately? What has JR done this year that\u2019s worth being mentioned? I\u2019ll wait. \n\nI\u2019m not talking about what he did years ago. How does that help us this year? Please enlighten me. \n\nLike I said if JR was good or had a decent contract he wouldn\u2019t be a Cleveland Cavalier and that\u2019s a simple fact. Sorry your boy isn\u2019t producing this year or last year but we have to go back to 2016 to see what he\u2019s done. You\u2019re of the Carmelo mentality dreaming about his prime when the reality is the player is washed.  \n\nThe Lakers organization was ready to get rid of Kobe because he wasn\u2019t producing. The only reason he got an extra 2 years is because he\u2019ll go down as one of the greatest players in Lakers history. You expect me to give JR smith an extra 2 years because he hit a couple shots in the finals? Lmaooooooooo\n\nThank you JR Smith. You hit a couple shots in 2016 to help us win but any other player in the NBA could have done the same. Lebron and Kyrie just carried you to put in that position. ", "I wasn't trying to be a dick, im just floored at what happened with the reviewed called and GH/JR mess. Never seen anything like that in my life", "Dude if you're seriously trying to say he was only trying to hand it off to Lebron for a last second shot you may have a gold medal in metal gymnastics \n\nYou're saying the top of the arc, I honestly dont know if you just haven't looked at the play your if you're joking with me\n\nAnd wtf is this why would you throw your teammate under the bus bullshit you're talking about? Am I a teammate of JR? When did I EVER say that?", "GH is getting a pass for sure. We're over here talking about JR only because Hill choked the shot. JR made a terrible play, but it's hard for me to say he choked. The game was in GH's hands to win it, but he kinda shrinks in these moments. Hindsight, lebron should have just taken a shot over curry\n\nBut i agree, missed shot happens, not knowing the situation as a pro is insane", "And we\u2019re only talking about GH\u2019s shot bc the refs fucked us first with like 5 calls that were dumb and went against us. Honestly though, this team proved they\u2019re there to compete and LeBron still has even more up his sleeve. This should be a fun series if they don\u2019t let this demoralize them", "Well we are talking about it because even with the refs continuous and obvious help the warriors should have 100% lost\n\nBut yes, lebron is going to have to average 35 a game (which he can) and players like love and nance need to keep showing up. This team seems to match up with the warriors (we'll see what it looks like it AI returns healthy tho)", "That\u2019s a big if.

I  actually was rooting for LBJ this year and was disappointed when they lost game 3.  Here's the thing with Jordan - he totally dominated his colleagues.  It's not about MJ vs LBJ, to me it's about how much better MJ was than everyone else.  I mean, the entire NBA has gotten faster/stronger.  If you took those 90s guys and put them in today's game, they would totally adjust.  MJ's performances were incredible, and he NEVER let you down when it counted.  Basically, for 6 straight full seasons, MJ walked out on top. He never lost. We never saw him lose when it counted. In my mind, the level of dominance MJ had, the playoffs could have been 8 more rounds. You just knew down in your gut he would be last man standing. While I was watching it I'd be like there's no way Bulls are gonna win AGAIN right...and guess what? MJ would pull it out. Again and again. Simply put, he never lost. That's totally different than saying oh LBJ made it further more times.  Don't fall for the mystique that just reaching the Finals is some rarified air. Look at how pathetic the Eastern conference opponents have been this year. PG choked away games. Raptors didn't show up. Basically, my admiration for MJ stems from the fact that you always knew he would be last man standing. I just wish he hadn't taken those 2 years off in his prime. I was so mad at him. At his peak, MJ could score from anywhere get anywhere and had not an iota of self doubt. More than his physical prowess, he was the most self confident athlete I've ever seen and he always always always lived up to his reputation. The MJ folks who say 6 for 6 aren't just talking about pure numbers.

I think they still have draft picks to use in deals but I haven't looked that up and don't know.  \n  \nUnless of course the fucking universe aligns and their entire bench sans Iggy re-signs for a David West/Javale contract. Then I'll have to ski-mask and go after Adam Silver.", "I edited my post before the asterisk showed up but after you read it I think.  \n  \nAdded \"at least top 3\" and a few other bits about other players, but you named the other two of my top 3.", "He's done so many small trades here and there to manage to cap to fit all the people LeBron wanted.

Lebron is the best all around basketball player to ever play the game. When you compare what he's done, who he's played against, and who he's had on his team, he's it.

We're talking pure numbers and competition here, and it's undebatable that in their conference, Jordan had better competition.  I do believe Lebron is the best all around player of all time, but that doesn't just make him the GOAT.  And the fact that Jordan lost in the first round and was 1-9 is not a blemish on his career when you consider the context of who he went against and how he performed.", "He was 23.  He was still early in his career, even if he didn't start as early as Lebron.  Which is why it's fine Lebron didn't make the playoffs his first (3?) years, since it basically puts them at the same starting point.  But you comparing Lebron's stats at 32 to Jordan's at 23 is completely ridiculous, regardless of how long Jordan was in college.  That's seasoned vet Lebron you're comparing to second year Jordan with a shit team.", "I appreciate the nice discussion. Go cavs.", "The point is Jordan and LeBron both played in a watered down league. Jordan never beat the Celtics, Pistons or Lakers in their prime. He beat Barkley, Clyde, Gary Paton, and Malone/Stockton. Three of his championships came against teams with only ONE hall of hame player. People forget that during the 1991 NBA Finals, Jordan could not guard Magic Johnson and Pippen had to guard him instead. \n\n\nCompare this to LeBron's opponents, 07 Spurs had Manu Ginobli, Tony Parker and Tim Duncan. Followed by the 2015 Warriors with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. And Finally the 2017 Warriors with Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. I won't count 11 and 12, because 11 was a choke job and 12 was against players who had not entered their prime. \n\nLeBron has faced just as many if not more Hall of Fame players than Michael Jordan. Jordan has faced 9 Hall of Fame opponents while LeBron has faced 26. ", "You're a Stan cause your blindly following what other people tell you, lol.

Didn't you see the post the other day about how Lebron has faced faced 25+ hall of famers in the finals, repeating players obviously, while Jordan played like 9. Schools out, so I know you saw that shit. So why the fuck does it not matter who Jordan played, but you past Stans shit on Lebron for losing to the greatest team of all time that added Kevin Durant?

Get back to me when you get those numbers instead of cherry picking who they beat in the Finals.", "Jordan's competition was in the East, Lebron's was in the West.

MJ beat Drexler, Payton, and Reggie in their prime.", "All great teams.  How many Hall of Famers?  4, maybe 5?", "Derrick Rose was the youngest MVP in NBA history.

I remember them shooting light out, as I was at the watch parties at the Q. \n\nEdit: fuck, I forgot about the pistons too, with Billups, Rip, Wallace, Wallace, prince... you recognize any of those names?", "That doesn't make it prime.  It is undebatable that Rose still had more to untap, which is why his career is arguably the biggest \"what if\" in NBA history.  And did you really include beating a second year Kawhi on your list lol?  I think he's on trajectory to be in the HoF for sure, but he's still young.  And that still doesn't compare to the long list of people Jordan would have to go through, just to get to the Finals and go through somebody else.\n\nFor all the people you listed, that's 3 teams.  2 are in the West, 1 in the East that didn't compare.  Still not a tougher road to the Finals than Jordan.\n\n", "4 I was thinking was KG, Pierce, Allen, and Howard (3 time consecutive DPOY).  Paul George was the maybe, Rose at this point is a nope unless he has an amazing back half.\n\nJordan had no shortage of great players to go against either.  DPOYs, all time great teams, deep teams like the Knicks, great defenses, etc.  It's not like it was just Hall of Famers surrounded by bums.

And now these bum ass Warriors that cupcake Durant ran too. ", "While I'm sure a lot of teams would sleep easier knowing Lebron isn't around, it's because the competition is nowhere close.  When he was on the Heat, those were some tough teams that led to some of Lebron's best performances in his career, period (Game 6 Celtics).  But there isn't any super solid team in the East that looks like they could go blow for blow with Lebron (the teams that faced Jordan could, they just didn't win because he's Jordan).\n\nWarriors were still one of/the best team in the league without him.

Maybe he knows something the rest of us don't.\n\n\n\n\nLiterally no chance he's staying. This Cavs team is a legit lottery team without LeBron. At age 33, 15th season, he played all 82 games, hitting game winners after game winners, game winning blocks, and took this team to the playoffs, despite the reshuffle of the roster 3 times middle of the season. Lost his superstar point guard middle of the season as well, and got a midget back\n\n>\n\n\nAfter playing all 82 games, he single handedly won his team that series against Indiana. Not one of Bron's teammates cracked double figures in that series, until Game 7. Not one of LeBron's teammates scored 20 or more points in that entire series. \n\n>\n\n\nThen he went ahead and swept the Raptors, number 1 seed. Even vegas had the Cavs as underdogs in that series. Then Boston, again not one of his teammates could hit a shot. Played all 48 minutes in Game 7 and sealed his team the win. Boston's first loss in their home court in the playoffs as well. \n\n>\n\n\nThen, a super team, with 4 superstars all in their prime. Golden State. Cavs are the biggest underdogs in the last 20 years of NBA finals history, per Vegas and all other betting sites. LeBron walks in to their arena, and drops 51 on 65% shooting. Durant, Dray, Klay, Livingston, Looney all tried to guard him, but looked like children next to Bron. \n\n\n>\n\n\nCavs had the lead, 40 seconds left. Then refs overturn a charge call, gives GSW back the ball and 2 free throws. That was the game changer. Even then Cavs still had a shot, but George Hill misses a free throw to win the game, then JR gets a rebound over Durant and has a 2 footer to win the game, instead he runs out the clock thinking they have the lead.. Ty Lue, the hall of fame coach, had a time out left, and he doesn't use it. LeBron loses it, it literally kills him inside, and game over. \n\n>\n\n\nGame 1 sealed LeBron's departure papers.

Multiple firsts, Sexton, Okoro, and probably a lot more. No. Thanks. And that\u2019s not even mentioning the injuries.

I get it, he\u2019s an elite scorer and solid defender, and one of the best players in the league, but there is a ton of risk in trading for him given what we\u2019ll have to give up to get him.

I take some solace in Ricky\u2019s play style too which isn\u2019t too reliant on speed or athleticism", "I think he's saying that NBA players don't drop off a cliff after 30 like they used to anymore. These aren't NFL running backs.", "I think we could get some center on a veteran minimum, which can be always used regardless of cap situation?", "And then he would just demand another trade like he is with Brooklyn, it\u2019s a huge gamble to sell the farm for him when there\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019s going to want to finish out his contract on the team.", "[deleted]", "Dude vanity searches his name on twitter and fights with people who don't even play pick up games let alone be able to make it to the league.", "You know what?

So outside of other moves only a spot for one more FA.", "I'd rather see how far we can get with Allen and this squad.
