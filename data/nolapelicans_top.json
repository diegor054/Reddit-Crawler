His touch around the rim for a big man is best I've ever seen, and there is no lob that he can't finish.  His jumper is super strong, and he just has so many fantastic skills.

I am with you though hoping we flip them.", "I'd like to see both but I honestly doubt we do anything with them. \n\nI've got a feeling that we'll lock in with the young core around Jrue. Lonzo-Jrue-Ingram-Zion-4th pick is probably what we're gunna ride with for a bit unless some semi big name comes up on the market. \n\nBut with Bradley Beal not being available I can't see us making any moves unless Knicks or Grizzlies love the idea of Lonzo/Ingram/4th for 2 or 3.", "Lonzo is a great *fastbreak* passer. \n\nHe's horrendous in the pick and roll. He can't throw lobs accurately. He can't run an NBA offense. \n\nHaving Gentry as a coach would help but he doesn't have NBA passing skills like people swear he does. \n\nDefense is good though.

Yes AD is probably top 5-top 10 currently when he's healthy.\n\nBUT LeBron's gonna be 34 next season, AD has already proven he isn't the guy to take a team of \"role players\" far by himself. Even if they're able to add Kemba or another guy, they still have Kuzma and absolutely no one else on the bench. Patchwork teams like that usually take a while to actually click, and then when they do they never end up being all that great anyway.

Time and time again this team has been decimated by injury woes. Both the CP3 and AD eras were destroyed because of injuries. We just signed a guy who led the legendary Suns medical staff but I'm not convinced that will even help us. \n\nIn the last two seasons Hart has played 130/164, Ingram has played 111/164, and Lonzo has played 99/164. \n\nThis shit is scary.

Idk who would take it but damn I hate ball.", "Statistically your'e right. Can't deny it. And your worry about injuries is totally justified. That is my biggest worry with him as well. I can't really back up anything with statistical evidence, but from watching him for a couple years, he really can be an impact player and his potential is through the roof if he can avoid injuries. \n\nThe main issue with him is that it seems like it takes him a long time to adjust. His game is completely chemistry driven. And every time he got injured or there was any significant change it seemed like it took him a long time to adjust.

I really believe ya'll will like him more than you think.", "I like Ingram in this trade and whatever #4 can land us in a subsequent trade but that's about it. The other two picks are going to be in the 20's as we well know and landing a decent player outside of the top 10 even in a deep draft is tough.

You're sending around a free 23rd or higher pick and Josh Hart for RJ Barrett.", "Yeah but they have a roster to fill out. Adding one or two more players wont make that roster.

You'd have worse lottery odds with AD playing 20ish games.

They\u2019re 2021 and 2023.", "Lmao if you actually think Lonzo has anything going in the pick and roll then I know you don't know what you're talking about. That's been his biggest flaw as a point guard since college. Even more damaging than his inability to shoot or score.", "The loterry is a crapshoot. No way the NBA if they controlled the lottery would have let Zion slip away from ny or LA. pelicans still probably would have won it regardless so I doubt the trade had anything to do with that.

If anything AD and Bron will be fun to watch.", "We've found guys like Kuzma, LNJ, and Hart all late first round. There is talent there you just gotta find it.", "That's a fair assessment. Zo needs to work on his offensive game for sure. But if you guys do field him I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how he affects the team on the floor. His defense is understated because he can really clamp down on that end and he energizes the team with a lot of his plays.  \n\n\nAs a passer we already know what he can do. More importantly having watched him for the last two years I've always noticed how much more speed and urgency the team plays in general when Zo is on the floor. He has a plethora of intangibles that unfortunately are undermined by his lackluster offensive game. Don't get me wrong I think he needs to work on that if he's to have a place in this league but I guess I just have faith that given his physical tools and athleticism he'll at the very least become a decent finisher around the rim.", "In his current state? Hard to say. BI's numbers don't scream max but he's got an interesting growth trajectory that we've seen from him in the years of playing in LA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe seems to focus on attacking one facet of his game one at a time. In his second year he drilled down on attack the rim and getting to the paint to score or get to the line. The first month or so of the season - he looked absolutely terrible not going to lie. But as the season carried on he slowly started to become more and more effective.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can actually see this if you break down his stats by month\n\n[https://stats.nba.com/player/1627742/traditional/](https://stats.nba.com/player/1627742/traditional/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIgnoring since it was only 4 games you'll see that his scoring average ticked up every month. His post All-Star numbers are eye -popping though admittedly sample size is small.  In other words I'd wait and see. In his second year he attacked the rim, this past year he worked on his mid range shot, I was hoping to see him begin working on his 3pt shot this upcoming year and start to see him come together as a complete package.  \n\n\nSo do I think that he's worth that max contract right now? Probably not. But I do believe that he'll become that max contract player given some more time. Unfortunately in Laker land patience is a scarcity. I think with a coach like Alvin Gentry, proper 3 pt spacing (again something he didn't have in LA), and good offensive system you'll begin to see BI really shine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlus with them long ass limbs of his - he gets some amazing blocks.", "He\u2019s a Lakers fan", "Especially once they trade for Conley to replace Kyrie", "You don\u2019t see how they would be a 5 team with AD, LeBron and a max player?

I think you're scarred as a Pels fan and are expecting this to fall through because you (like me and all Pels fans) are used to years of front office incompetence.

It's why no one wanted it. 1-3 probably could have been trade straight up for like Bradley beal. 1-3 is all that matters. All analysts have said the draft value drops significantly after 1-3.", "> He shot 50% from the field this year despite shooting 33% from three\n\nBecause he barely shot any threes. He gets to the free throw line and is a good finisher so that brings the numbers up. He shot ~40% from mid range this season. An okay number but far from good enough to justify being a primarily mid range guy. \n\n>Who do you want for Ingram and Zo in that case out of curiosity? Any ideas in mind?\n\nI honestly have no idea what kind of value they have around the league. We're gunna be looking to flip that 4 pick most likely, so if we could do Lonzo + 4 for 3 from New York? Maybe go for Lonzo, Ingram, 4 for 2 from Memphis and get Morant. \n\nSuns have loved Lonzo for a while, that's pretty well known. But I don't really value any of their assets besides Booker and Ayton, and we're not getting either of them. \n\nI don't know how far Houston is going off the deep end, but if they're really trying to shake it up I'd do Capela for Lonzo and something else (maybe E'twaun or something). \n\nI honestly have no idea. Any trade I come up with right now could be totally and entirely off. I never assumed we'd be getting these guys so I never looked at the possible trades that could happen afterward.", "It's not a correction if he doesn't have the information. \n\nLiterally every pick trade that Woj drops has this same thing. \n\n[He didn't even have any of the assets for Boogie.](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/833537296007823361?lang=en)", "You don't value #6 from Suns? It's not an amazing pick, but it's a shot at Culver, Garland, or Hunter whichever one falls at #6. It's not a terrible pick. I think maybe Lonzo for #6 and if you think that's not enough as you indicated before maybe TJ Warren or something along those lines. It'll be interesting to see what we do, I think. I think those '21 and '23 picks pending what protections are on them, could end up being super valuable. If they're unprotected those picks could both very well be lottery with LeBron if he starts to show his age. We know all too well how often AD gets injured, so all it takes is LeBron aging and AD getting hurt for those picks to be top 5. I think it could've been better, but with the rumors that the Nets and Celtics weren't offering as much as they should without a commitment from AD to re-sign thanks to Rich Paul, I doubt anyone was offering anything better.", "I don't think Lonzo for #6 straight up is really a smart trade though. Lonzo has more value than that. He's a former number 2 in only his 3rd year with a ton of team control still over him. A team like the Suns who are desperate for a PG would give up waaaaaaay more than the 6th pick in a mediocre draft. If they had shooters I'd be into it. But they don't have anybody who would shoot. If they had any centers who could protect the rim I'd be into it. But they don't have anybody like that either. Their only other interesting assets are Josh Jackson (headcase that I don't want near this team) and Mikal Bridges (maybe but I really don't know how I feel about him). \n\nI also doubt there were better offers but I also still don't like this trade if we don't get more from these assets we acquired.", "Fair enough, I hope we either flip them for assets everyone is happy about or you're proven wrong!", "I hope so too dude!

The Boogie trade was great; Demps can't control his health. \n\nHe also made solid moves at the margins like Bryce Dejean-Jones, Randle,  Rondo, Elfrid, Miller, Okafor, Kenny Hustle, etc.\n\nHe wasn't great, but he also wasn't as bad as many people say.", "Who is a troll?", "Well, Rondo wasn't really asking for all that much, to be fair.

As for Boogie, I will say that Cousin is a fuckin snake, but that report seems a little ambiguous. Especially considering that Cousins seemed relatively honest that the Pels didn't offer anything, which really seems likely given Demps' track record. \n\nAs for the rest, a lot of Demps' moves were really high gambles, since he was always hoping this guy or that guy would reach their potential or whatever it was he saw in them. If we're counting, the only ones to actually live up to that were Jrue and Tyreke. Everyone else were just lucky breaks Demps had.

Rondo made $3M. We only had the MLE available which was about $8.5M we offered the entire MLE to Rondo. He took $9M from the Lakers. We could not possibly match that because we did not have the cap space. \n\nPeople blame Demps for things out of his control.

It's not like we have the ability to cut a bunch of these guards. Except maybe Moore or Bertans. But then again, I see Moore being put in as a backup SF since they've done that before. Even if it wasn't exactly the most ah... effective use of his talents. Also, I'm not sure how they'd get cut since they're both on contract.", "Lol rough. At least you still get to watch KAT. And at least we\u2019re both subbed here so we can watch and enjoy the pels success vicariously", "Ouch", "This. Frank Jackson becomes a 5th guard hopefully only getting minutes in blowouts. But we should be able to stagger Lonzo/Jrue enough to where one is always a PG while Hart and JJ are on the floor.\n\nIf we dont trade him, Moore only fills in at backup SF, hopefully. But I think he's gone if we need the extra $12mil for a big who can shoot (*cough*Horford*cough*)", "There is a possibility Lonzo comes off the bench, depends on how well he can push the pace.", "who", "JJ won quite a few \"most athleticism\" awards at Duke, and with the Magic and Clippers. He's insanely quick and balanced. \n\nAlso, I choose my fandom solely based on who JJ is playing for, so I am now a Pelican for at least 2 years", "I don\u2019t see how this changes anything about what I said. He comes of the bench and plays alongside Lonzo or jrue is how it will likely work since jrue can play 1 and 2.\n\nEdit. Only way this isn\u2019t the case is if Lonzo isn\u2019t in our long term plans or somehow doesn\u2019t mind not starting", "Yeah in reality what would happen there is JJ would be guarding 1 or 2 and Jrue would slide to guard the 3. He's guarded PG and KD in the past so he's up to it. It's essentially a 3 guard lineup but Jrue can hold himself with most wing players. (I don't see that lineup getting much run but it's an option)", "Magic fan, completely agree lol. Just let him do what he does best", "He did some for the Clippers, but I don't watch many Sixer games.", "Yeah, I guess I'm remembering him on the Clippers. Philly fans have kindly informed me he's not playable there any longer.", "What\u2019s Pelicans Wave?", "Pretty much the *only* thing I'm mad about is Rich Paul sabotaging us by saying he'd only re-sign with LA. We could have had some great packages from teams willing to take the risk after Kawhi just won a fucking championship and PG stayed in OKC", "tempering expectations is all.", "JJ is like Moore, he has and can play the 3 in some matchups.", "I mean it\u2019s one of the few things he\u2019s truly good at. I give it less than a 1% chance he doesn\u2019t start", "lmao you really haven't watched a lot of Lonzo have you..... He will start bro book it", "Jonathon Hart", "Finally, I'm not alone. I'll follow J.J to any team.", "You do realize that Jrue has gone one record saying that he doesn't want to run the point, right? Also, the way you wrote it made it appear as though you had Lonzo, Redick, and Jrue as part of the PG depth chart.", "He didn't run it well, and that was years ago. JJ lost a step.", "An Instagram account. Highly recommended.", "I don't think the package could have been any better. We literally got everything LA could have offered that we would want. Especially in the context of them having the #4 overall pick. \n\nThis, so far at least, honestly seems like the best possible timeline. Have to see what we do with the remaining salary cap space.", "If he can, then that solves that issue. But he still is going to get beat more often than not, right? Since he isn't a true SF and his real position is at SG. Honestly, we're way too deep at guard and going into the season with only one vet center and a rookie scares the hell out of me. We also need to find another PG if Payton isn't coming back. Lonzo can't do it all by himself and Jrue has made it clear he isn't running point anymore.", "I have, I don't think he will come of the bench, but it's more likely then Jrue or Ingram. Rondo started most of the season over him last year. Even when he was healthy.", "There\u2019s literally 2 of us!\n\nI also refuse to play with any other team on 2k than the team that JJ is on", "Ok bud I guess you know better, thanks. I\u2019m just stating what\u2019s obviously the only way this works because JJ isn\u2019t signing to be a backup with little to no minutes.", "The only possible better timeline we could have gotten IMO is both us and a trade partner getting the top 2 picks, other than that I don\u2019t think a better deal was available considering Kyrie wasn\u2019t staying in Boston (so Boston wasn\u2019t open to trading Tatum).", "I don\u2019t see us adding another PG with this move. Obviously they have to like Frank Jackson as our backup PG. otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have retained him. He\u2019s definitely not being kept to be a SG with the logjam we have there.\n\nRedick is not going to be better than Moore at guarding forwards and Moore struggles against the bigger ones. But keep in mind both Jrue and theoretically Lonzo can (and do, Jrue guarded Durant for goodness sake in the playoffs) guard forwards. And in a switch heavy defense you\u2019ll see guards defending forwards all the time anyways.\n\nThe fact that we have so many big guards makes it easier for us to get away with playing essentially 3 of them at once. And that\u2019s how Gentry has wanted this roster from the start.\n\nThe fact is really good forwards are really expensive and hard to find right now. When you have Harrison Barnes getting $88 million, you\u2019re just not going to get value for that position unless you get one of the max guys (like Kawhi or Durant). In fact that\u2019s why having a max forward seems to have more impact than anywhere else. \n\nOur best hope is Ingram develops into one as well. Because god knows even if he falls far short he\u2019ll still command an astronomical salary.", "\ud83d\ude02 i always put my MyCareer player on whatever team JJ's on just so I can dime him all game.", "Yes because only starters get any minutes in the NBA. Everyone else gets little to none.  /s\n\nJJ is a 35 year old. Getting a solid defined role on a team desperate for shooters is exactly what he\u2019s looking for. He\u2019s our backup SG.", "The real problem with this thinking is that we actually want Frank at PG instead of SG, which he had been playing the majority of his season with the Pels. Sure, he's listed as a PG, but that doesn't mean mean he's actually good enough to play as one in the NBA. If he were, then we wouldn't have been relying on Tim Frazier this entire time. So, there's that. If anyone is being moved up, it's probably NAW. Which, to be honest, doesn't exactly inspire confidence seeing as he's a rookie. \n\nAs for Redick, I feel like he'd come off the bench after Jrue. But then that makes you wonder what Hart is going to do, especially considering the log-jam. Would we just have him as a third option SG or would he and Redick share being the backup based on matchups? It's pretty troubling, honestly. \n\nAlso, I know that having a lot of guard depth gives us an advantage, but not like this. We're too deep with guards, and even if it is hard to get good forwards, it's still a risk worth taking. If we weren't going to max someone, giving a SF a decent contract to work as insurance in case Ingram has issues would be a good idea. Not to mention, Okafor is going to have it hard if he doesn't have decent backup.", "We\u2019re the same person I swear lmao", "Jrue is going to play 30-36ish minutes, if JJ is his back up you you think he\u2019s cool with potentially as little as 12 minutes a game(he averaged over 30 a game last year) ? No he\u2019s going to be in there with jrue sometimes", "Why retain Jackson then? With Jrue, Redick, Hart, Moore, Alexander-Walker, where are Frank's minutes at the 2?\n\nThey have to see him as a PG even if he looked better at SG.", "It'd be freaky if you were a gay female too \ud83d\ude02", "Jrue still plays point. He prefers the 2, but can still do the 1 really well.", "I mean, if Bertans is waived and you move Moore to the 3, then you can have NAW serve as a third PG and Jackson becomes the fourth SG. But that's assuming we re-sign Payton and NAW is only getting garbage time minutes for development. If we don't resign him...then I guess we would have a PG/SG line up like this:\n\nLonzo/ Jackson / NAW\n\nJrue / Redick / Hart / Moore\n\nThat's the only way I see this working honestly. I dunno how much faith they have in Jackson as a backup guard if they actually let Frazier take those minutes. But in the end, I guess that really is up to them. Also....uh...Randle just signed with the Knicks. Holy shit.", "I\u2019m a straight dude, but...we both like women so...another thing in common? \ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s literally what I\u2019ve been fucking saying!!!", "Can't imagine we ever intended to bring Randle back. I'm hoping for Dedmon, I think he's a better match with Zion (and cheaper).\n\nI think Gentry has always wanted to run 3 guards, not just out of necessity, and if 2 of the 3 are Lonzo and Jrue who can basically switch onto anyone, you have a wide range of options for the 3rd guard.", "Close enough \ud83d\ude02", "I know! I'm agreeing! JJ will get plenty of minutes!", "It sounds like your saying you think the lineup will operate with fixed positions and Jrue/JJ will spend all 48 minutes at 2... even though Jrue has slid into the 1 all time for his whole career. \n\nJrue playing 32 doesn\u2019t mean JJ will have a 12-minute role, which is what you said.", "Well, I hoped we could, since Randle is a damn good player even if his defense could use a little work. As for Dedmon, I'm not sure we'll net him. You never know with these guys sometimes. \n\nAs for Gentry, I feel like the only thing he's wanted to do is just blindly imitate GSW. I feel like he's not the type of coach that'll adjust his scheme to fit the players, instead of the other way around. I get the effectiveness of a 3-guard line-up, but finding three guards that can guard multiple positions is about as hard as finding a decent SF. In any case, I hope Gentry is able to adjust his scheme to fit our lineup.", "Haha alright. I\u2019m so confused what these guys are trying to argue. I\u2019m not saying he won\u2019t get minutes, just that the only way he can get those minutes is if jrue plays point sometimes while Lonzo sits. He won\u2019t solely come in when jrue is off the floor and JJ, jrue, and a PG on the floor just doesn\u2019t sound good. I think he will get 24-30 minutes playing alongside jrue or Lonzo", "I\u2019m over simplifying it obviously but the gist of it is the only way JJ gets really significant minutes is if plays alongside jrue and I don\u2019t think jrue, JJ and a point guard in the floor is a good line up. I have now spelled it out for you as best as I can do you get it...", "I think we'll essentially have a 3 guard lineup with Frank sprinkling in some rest here or there for them.\n\nDo you think we run Moore as a backup 3 or do we try to move him for a more natural 3?", "I don\u2019t see him getting many if any minutes. I want them to get time for hart and JJ, JJ is a great bet to have and we have to keep him happy."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

He also let JV play for way too long IMO, it was obvious JV wasn't having much success offensively and the rebounding advantage wasn't enough to offset the defensive issues vs that small ball lineup.

He finishes at an elite level near the rim... but this is all in the regular season. \n\nThe reason I brought up the defense walling off the paint is because, while its designed to slow down a 7 foot athletic freak, it absolutely shuts down a 6 foot athletic freak. As strong as Bled is, he can't power through an entire defense like Giannis can. \n\nWhen Bled isn't able to get to the rim it brings his whole game down which is what happens in the playoffs all of the time. \n\nHere's the thing, though... Your giant athletic freak can shot way, way better than our giant athletic freak. I think this opens things up for Bled to be more successful in the playoffs than he was here. \n\nHoliday is great for us because he's the only guy on Bled's level on defense (wait to watch Bled play Booker and Harden, he must hate them dudes the way he gets after them) and his size and shooting are where we get the upgrade.

Skyrim was also my jam but turned into too much of a time sink.", "You're both fucking weird ", "Punish the org for not controlling their players.  In college sports, the reason would be lack of institutional control.", "You can go through my comment history from when Boogie joined the Warriors.

", "Small market teams don\u2019t have that many opportunities to sign stars like Boogie. It was a risk that shoulda been taken.", "Wait, what is happening in this thread?", "this is fucking hilarious lollllllll", "But what does controlling their players mean? Do you believe employers should have a say in the private conversations of their employees? Do you think your job should be allowed to dictate what you say to other people outside the workplace?\n\n(College sports is a tough example as the NCAA is an exploitation machine that's very existence seems to be built upon screwing over their unpaid labor force)", "Congrats. I was hopeful he\u2019d come back normal too but I\u2019m not walking around acting like everyone was stupid for having legitimate concerns. With an injury like that with someone his size it could\u2019ve gone either way and the majority of past cases suggested that there would be a drop off", "He wanted basically a max deal after tearing his Achilles. That's a super super risky deal for a team with a small window \n\nIf we had a young core of stars on rookie deals I'd be ok with it. But given our roster it would have killed any chance of us having a semblance of depth (our depth is still terrible now even with guys we signed, so imagine how it would look without them and boogie being gone in the entire first half of the season)", "Is it a university's fault when a coach does things on the side that are against NCAA rules? They had no knowledge, yet the coach gets fired and then the school is punished and has to pay the price for a coach's decision.  \n\nI'm just saying that orgs can be more strict on reiterating players 'Don't do this'.  In the current state, LA can go to LeBron and tell him to go talk to players for them because that's not illegal.", "It really doesn't matter what we or the media thought, it matters what Davis thought. And I am sure Davis had confidence that Boogie would be back in good shape.", "I understand that, the situation in Sacremento with just Boogie and some meh-good roleplayers wasn't ideal either. But the thing here is there was a chance this could have at least upped the chances of keeping Anthony Davis a little bit. Anthony Davis is one of the top 3-4 talents in the league. This isn't an opportunity you get more than once. Davis thought that with Boogie that playoff series against the WARRIORS would have been a different story. With Boogie coming back like he is now, you guys would have started competing for a playoff spot. And the duo of Davis and Boogie really was deadly. Even if Boogie wasn't 100 percent by playoffs yet showed he was greatly improving from injury and you guys still lost, maybe Davis would think to himself, that's fine with a fully healthy Boogie next year we can have a chance. I'm not saying Boogie alone could have altered Davis' decision but there is a chance he could have. And that is a chance you need to do anything for when it involves such a generational talent.", "What Im asking you is this: how can an organization stop private conversations?  If they tried to make a rule against literally speaking to other players, the union would sue the league. What possible means don't have to stop LeBron and Davis from talking? Until you address that this is just not rational", "All your responses in this thread are blanket assumptions of what you think AD wanted or expected. You don\u2019t actually have any insight to those things so how about you base your argument on something legit ", "We would have been like 15 or 20 games under .500 by the time he came back if we signed Boogie instead of having Randle and Mirotic instead. There's no 100% no way we compete for the playoffs this year if we signed him", "I'm not saying they have the means.  But if a player is actively, publicly courting another player, do something about it."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

I am really disheartened because I felt like Franz Wagner would have been an amazing addition to this teams future, but maybe some players move up out of nowhere and we still land some significant talent that fits our team/timeline. \n\nWe\u2019ve improved through subtraction by getting rid of Bledsoe, and got a slightly better center. Our defensive issues still remain and since we\u2019re not interested in keeping Lonzo we have even more ground to cover into putting out a decent defense (could be league worst the way we\u2019re currently heading). \n\nIf this move helps us land Lowry, we\u2019d have Lowry NAW Zion BI JV, that\u2019s a scary ass team on offense, the defense really worries me though. Wish we could keep Lonzo while still getting Lowry, would still prefer turner too over JV.", "FLEECED", "ADAMS IS GONE GOD IS REAL", "This is our first good personnel move in two years!

Honestly, Jonas getting an extension, which he is eligible for, should be a no-complainer if we can get it for 3 years near Adams price.", "Love this trade for both teams. Hope y'all enjoy JV, he's a walking double double and an instant folk hero.", "Holy shit", "Strap in boys!! LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO!!!!", "Pels fan here. I like the Jonas move, but I really think Adams will thrive in Memphis. And they will love him", "Man, this worked out great for us! :)", "I guess the JV hive is going to the big easy", "Sign Lowry now", "This is a good pickup. Still lacking on perimeter defense. Jonas gets cooked on switches but an upgrade offensively. Lowry and Jonas doesn't make sense. Lowry wants around 25-30mil and average basically the same numbers as lonzo on lower 3pt percentage. He's an aging star with a very short window to contribute. Makes more sense to keep Zo at 20-25mil and pick up shooters with the rest", "I think this is not as much of a slam dunk that everyone thinks it is, but it really depends on how the young guys do this year Hayes/NAW specifically. Honestly I think if 2 of Hayes/NAW/Kira don't ball out this year this team is about as good as last year and this trade will blow up in their face.  \n\n\nI think moving to JV from Adams, is decent. I hope the fit is better but we're acting like JV is a shooter when really he averaged 1 three a game. He's still best in the post similar to Adams where you can take advantage of his rebounding. Also JV got played off the floor in the playoffs multiple years, so even if the team makes the playoffs you can't really count on him. Then even if JV has a great year you still have to pay him without bird rights. Getting rid of Bledsoe was necessary, sure, but you're really hoping NAW/Kira can play defense which although they're young they haven't shown much. Bledsoe was ass last year, but its more feasible that he gets back to a serviceable level than NAW/Kira becoming good defenders. So while this move gets rid of players we probably shouldn't have gotten in the first place it doesn't make the Pels any better at defense.   \n\n\nThen if you look at this history of number 10 picks most have been solid NBA players in their careers with a few all stars mixed in there (Paul George, CJ McCollum, Mikal Bridges are highlights). The history of the number 17 pick has a number of guys who almost immediately busted out of the league and the last all star level player picked 17 was Jrue in 2009. Not only that but we gave up one of the Lakers picks and moved from 40 - 51 which again could be productive players down the line that they just won't have.  \n\n\nSo while it was a bit necessary to move off past mistakes to have future flexibility, they have to nail number 17 AND spend the money they saved super wisely.   \n\n\nThe Pels have 4 main needs and just saved about 22 mil for next year with this trade.   \n1.) A steady point guard who can help the team make good decisions down the stretch (its too early to trust NAW/Kira for this if you want to make the playoffs)  \n2.) A solid wing defender who can ideally guard 2-4 and hit a 3 at a decent clip  \n3.) A good 3 pt specialist or bench scorer  \n4.) A third center  \n\n\nI think the team needs to nail all of these and have good health to be in the mix for a playoff spot and it still could fall apart in a play in game.", "> This is fantastic.\n\nNeutral fan here, I think this is a win win trade, but I think NOLA wins more, if that makes sense.", "Y\u2019all won this so easily lmao.

JV is a lot closer to Adams than he is to like Brook Lopez. Outside of that this trade didn't make our team better in any definite way, while the number 10 pick could have been a productive player or a decent trade asset down the line.

Way too many teams are interested if he ends up on the trading block.", "Getting down votes, but I 100% agree.  A front court of Zion and JV is awful defensively.

JV averages 3-4ft a games where ayton and McGee combined average that. Chris Paul used to average more but his FTA/game has declined the past two season.

How is it that you guys were 10 games under .500? You guys would easily beat the nuggets, jazz and Mavs unless Luka goes nuclear. With Zion next season you guys will be monsters.

CP not missing a shot you have to tip your hat but cmon, any other night he ain\u2019t doing that. The offensive foul on alvarado should have been overturned and who knows what happens from there. \n\nOverall I love CJ on the team and we can\u2019t underestimate his influence culturally, in the locker room and how he spaces the floor just by being out there - but he was disappointing this series and particularly today.\nSeeing Willie green cry really hit me hard - we\u2019ve got a good one. I hope this loss hurts and motivates the team and we come back more motivated next season.", "Suns fan coming in peace here. \n\nWillie Green is an inspiring coach, BI is a superstar in the making, Alvarado is the NOLA soul, and Zion\u2019s return is just around the corner.

The Jax/Val lineup was just NOT doing it.  Honestly, I think he needed to punt on Jonas in general in the 2nd half.  If Nance could go he needed to play the majority of the game.  \n\nAlso needed a changeup with the defense.  Idk why he didn't try and blitz CP3 and just get the ball out of his hands, especially in the minutes Book was sitting.  Just made no sense to me.  Never really forced him into bad situations.

Do you think he wants to be here? Do you think they\u2019re going to trade him for other pieces before he asks for a trade and get all the leverage? Just curious because I know coming into the league he really didn\u2019t want to be in New Orleans.

Thankfully, for you guys, you likely won't make the same mistake Detroit did by giving SVG personnel control which led to some awful contracts/draft picks (see: Reggie Jackson, Jon Leuer, Stanley Johnson, etc.).\n\nAs far as coaching goes, he's a tough-love guy, and players often say he is tough to play for at times, but they almost always respect him. My concern with SVG the coach isn't so much about philosophy as it is about how he goes about executing said philosophy. He still loves defense and he stills loves the 3-ball. However, his offense can get very, very one-trickery in terms of how it operates. For instance, the offense pretty much struggled every step of the way in Detroit, but at one point, he ran the offense through Andre Drummond (yes, I'm serious), and it actually worked for a while. However, eventually, teams adjusted but SVG didn't have an answer for their adjustment. Now, yes, you could blame a good bit of that on the roster SVG stuck himself with, and I would agree, but it did feel like at times the game had passed him by in Detroit. He was too concerned with role-fits rather than talent potential and he just didn't adjust enough. Again, there may be quality excuses for that, but the fact that Dwane Casey, another head coach who isn't exactly considered a top-tier strategist, outperformed SVG with nearly the same exact roster in the following season did give me some additional concern for SVG if he were to re-enter the job market (I actually thought he was done coaching by choice).\n\nAll that said, the Pelicans of now are far, FARRRRR beyond SVG's very BEST Pistons roster. You guys don't need to add a ton of talent to be competitive, you just need to groom/develop what you have. SVG has a pretty bad record with playing his draft picks, but many of the younger guys the Pelicans already have are what this team is going to be built around. While I wouldn't say I'm 100% sold on the SVG-Griffin pairing, you could do A LOT worse, as I'm sure you know. I look forward to seeing SVG in the upcoming season(s) and hope that he can make another run. Good dude and easy to root for.

Traded for Avery Bradley after KCP (thankfully) rejected his 5 yr/80m offer. He traded for Marcus Morris who was solid and also Reggie Bullock who was a solid contributor further down the line, he traded for Reggie, who from a pure trade standpoint, was a steal in terms of what they gave up (before his contract, of course). He actually did well in trades and hell, you could make the argument if Casey doesn't run Blake into the ground that Blake trade is another win for SVG in a vacuum (however, the way the team was trending that trade should've never been made).\n\nPersonally, I believe you make your team's foundation with a combination of FA/Drafting + development. Trades put you over the top in the end. However, in Detroit, trades were how we got anywhere. We overpaid for FA or attempted to overpay our own guys (Drummond, Boban, Leuer, Reggie, tried to overpay KCP) while we constantly took lower ceiling, lower floor draft picks during his tenure. \n\nI won't disagree with some that SVG got really, really unlucky. If Brandon Jennings doesn't go down, the Reggie Jackson trade probably doesn't happen, then if Jackson doesn't go down, the team probably doesn't fall into perpetual 8-11 seed mediocrity. However, he did himself no favors. In this league you need franchise star talent and this team flat-out missed on franchise-changing talent in the draft under SVG's watch and his only remedy for it, in the end, was to trade for Blake with his back up against the wall which pretty much pushed our rebuild window back a bit further. Then, he had to win-now, so it's understandable as to why he went about it the way he did (he wasn't ever going to be able to talk ownership into a rebuild at that point, or ever, really).

Boban is useful in certain matchups, but SVG the coach refuses to make lineup adjustments like that anyways. Overall it was a strange contract for a team strapped for cash due to bad signings and his decision to stretch Josh Smith.\n\nAnd I guess you can say drafting Spencer was a good move, but it\u2019s a wash for me since SVG the coach refused to play him so he could play the corpse of Steve Blake instead lol.

That's the biggest thing this team needs a coach that can instill a sense of professionalism. \n\nHe's also been pretty innovative when it comes to modern offenses, but for the next 2 to 3 years that's more of a bonus than the main concern.", "I have my doubts but it has more to do with the roster than Stan.

And Meeks also didn\u2019t look that good for us pre injury tbh. \n\nInjuries were certainly a huge problem for us, but all of his terrible deals, picks, signings, and his refusal to develop young players left us with no depth to overcome them.

We need these 3 especially to develop an on-court synergy, like Messi-Iniesta-Xavi. We can definitely create a three-pronged attack we just need to make a few adjustments\n\nBring in a coach who will see the Pelicans as a passion project. Bring in an All-Star to cover the shortfall up front, and in 3-4 years we can start being a realistic Championship team.

So they\u2019d need a trade that\u2019s better than getting westbrooks massive contract that\u2019s set to expire at the end of the year. They could in theory just let him expire and retool next year if they aren\u2019t getting value in a trade. Teams aren\u2019t likely to offer much for Westbrook considering he doesn\u2019t even seem playable at this point and clearly has attitude problems so he\u2019d have to be bought out near full contract value since it\u2019s unlikely annoying is going to sign him. They may not want to take on a hield or a turner if their contracts are more than one year because let\u2019s face it neither of those guys are moving the needle towards a championship with how bad this team is. To me the problem is AD, since the Westbrook situation will resolve itself end of year or by the trade deadline. Idk wtf you do with him cause he\u2019s not good enough to be the main option as Lebron declines, and he has limited trade value because he\u2019s fragile and frankly he\u2019s lost a step, or three or four", "Mr. T:  \u201cI pity the fool!\u201d", "He might not start but I think Trey is gonna be too good to play less than 30 a night.

So you have the cap flexibility to make room for improvement.\n\n\nPelicans obviously give up Lonzo to make room for free agents they target. Because that's one way to improve. But the organization is blamed for trying, because the free agent didn't come. And if Pels extended Lonzo, they will still get blamed for not even trying.

We have to build through the draft and Trades", "Only reason why I don\u2019t think Graham is the clear cut favorite other starter is because of the shot distribution. NAW is a gunner. Bi and Zion put up a lot of shots. One of NAW or Graham has to go to the 6th to carry the bench unit and have an absolute green light. Both will close every 4th, I\u2019m sure of it.", "Lonzo and Zach have been wanting this for some time now, I\u2019m happy for both. I\u2019m big big fans of both!! They have games that will maximize each other. I always follow players. I\u2019m rooting for the bulls too this year  \n\nSG will be NAW, I think he\u2019ll slide into the role we tried to turn Lonzo into. 3 and D with a secondary ball handling role. \nCP3 said Willie likes to play in transition, so I think we can somewhat positionless. If we\u2019re playing in the half court, Zion will be dominating the ball. Zions just a better, more versatile player onball. He can be offball in transition. So I think we will see a lot of Point Zion\n\nZion NAW BI Naji (or any other + defender) JV\nDefense: NAW BI Naji Zion JV\nThat would just be my guess", "To be fair I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d consider that being loaded with young talent. Guys a troll though for sure", "I been trying to tell them this, our core WAS loaded. It looks much weaker adding satoranksy while burning Zo", "And he was supposed to be drafted by his home team and win a championship for them. When he was drafted by Cleveland there was so much pressure to stay he had to make \"the decision\" to leave. When Zion leaves everyone outside of new Orleans will say finally he gets to go to the team that he was destine to play for the New York Knicks", "> Derozan is great bro, he\u2019s a winning player. The Spurs won alot more games than projected because of him\n\nBulls are still missing a PF. Zach, DeMar an Vooch aren't really gonna do a lot in defense. Bulls were very fortune to land Lonzo. Because of his size and defensive prowess. Then hopefully Patrick Williams can make a leap this season.\n\nBut unless Bulls land that PF star. It's hard to see them matching against the super teams. Though I had high hopes Bulls could land Siakam, if Masai made him available. Coby and Lauri are likely tradeable assets now for the Bulls.\n\n\n> I\u2019m just glad we\u2019re finally taking the youth and core approach. We have to build through the draft and Trades\n\n\nYes I feel you. But you guys done good so far. If Bulls didn't got lucky with Zach, it wouldn't attract Lonzo and DeRozan. But it's all part of business. A lot of promising pieces here. I like Trey Murph. Followed him in the daft. Jaxson Hayes. I followed him too. NAW and Kira as well. Graham as I've said in the other thread, drop 6/7 threes against Bulls in their first game in 2019-2020 season. Casual fans don't know how quick Graham could get hot. I laugh when they undermined this signing...", "Yeah NAW makes perfect sense as the playmaker. Graham is best used as a scoring guard.\n\n\nI'm hyped!\n\n\nPels has cap space next season with tons of developing piece. If top free agents wouldn't come. The players like Hayward in Charlotte. Even those guys could put this team over the top. Because of the rookie contracts that you can later package in trades.\n\n\nI always root for the small market teams. Because these are the orgs that develops their own team. Big markets just use money and piece up Prima Donnas and vet ring chasers. Like it's assembling a team in 2K.", "> Lonzo and Zach have been wanting this for some time now, I\u2019m happy for both.\n\nYeah. Can't wait to have LaVar in town. I grown to love LaVar. Raising three basketball pros is not easy. And we know these kids were raised well. Regardless of what comes out of LaVar's mouth. Can't take away he raised great men.\n\n\n>  Zions just a better, more versatile player onball. He can be offball in transition.\n\nTBH I want to see Zion and Hayes in the open court so bad. I can't think of bigs currently in the league who has their size that could run as fast. Imagine if those two has Kira at PG. Then maybe NAW and Trey Murph to balance the defense and playmaking in bench rotations. League has been sleeping on this team potential. But let them \ud83e\udd23\n\n\nWest are old now. It's just a matter of time Pels will took over...", "I mean you can add Zion and Ingram to that list, as well as Marshall. Just because they\u2019re all stars doesn\u2019t mean Zion and Ingram aren\u2019t young talent.", "Pels fans for some reason think that anyone not writing fluff pieces about how giddy and awesome all the acquisitions have been and how the FO can do no wrong is a Lonzo Stan, hater, or someone jealous that the Pels landed Zion. \n\nAs if this franchise can do no wrong and is a model of success and victory. \n\nI just want to see this team make the fucking playoffs and am tired of seeing Griffin fuck it all up", "julius randle on the run", "Yeah I know highlights aren\u2019t the best tell of a player but man his range and shotmaking abilities will help more than it will hurt. He has crazy clutch baskets, like somewhat a theme. We\u2019ll see \n\nPatrick Williams is that guy, I had him as a kawhi mold in the draft process. The game will slow down for him, his defense should be really good this year. Lonzo is so active and energetic, he rubs off on the players and fans. \n\nWe need a backup PF as well. You guys done with cap space? Millsap or Baynes is available. \n\n\nLastly who\u2019s the Bulls starting 5 the first game you think?", "Yes sir we not ready now like Chicago but we building Something and are trending upwards. \n\nPatrick Williams is about to take a step and Lavine will be all NBA. Maples and alot of other good basketball minds have him as this years Booker. He\u2019s been at that level \ud83d\ude02 but without the respect", "Lavar is great, that\u2019s mostly him but he knows how to use negative attention and turn it into $. You can\u2019t really blame him too much, he was Skip \u2018Baylessing\u2019 it. And true he is a great father \n\nYou see the vision!!! I really do believe that as well, that is the peak Pelicans. Hopefully we reach it.\nThe Suns core lost, The 76ers core lost, timberwolves good core will probably lose some more. \n\nWe have a legit future core along like other teams.\nYou guys are included. Lonzo Lavine Caruso PWill And White is a great group of young guys", "I just assumed Zion was excluded since it\u2019d be reasons for him to leave or whatever. Obviously including him along with Ingram carry that above every other \u201cyoung\u201d team. I just think the fall off after ingram is massive haha", "Never said they could do no wrong or called you a Lonzo Stan. You're getting downvoted because people disagree that we don't have young talent. Graham is a great young PG. NAW is about to start in his 3rd year. Hayes developed very well last season. Kira is promising. Murphy was an excellent pick at 17. We're loaded with young talent.", "I have been a fan for 17 years, we are going nowhere meaningful with Griffin. Sure we may get a playoff appearance or two but he won\u2019t be leading us to anything meaningful. They either have to let Traj make all Of the decisions or Get Lebron for DG, because DG is not the same without Lebron. everyone knew Lebron built that roster, from Kevin love to iman shimpert to jr smith to Kyle korver. The roster was hand picked by Lebron. \n\nDG is the worst POBO in the nba", "> He has crazy clutch baskets, like somewhat a theme. We\u2019ll see\n\nAgreed. BI and Graham could make those. It will hopefully free up Zion more. Zion needs space to operate. And now Pelicans have a center who can shoot. Very underrated free agency. Media won't accept or understand. But would jump on the bandwagon when the team is winning....\n\n\n> Patrick Williams is that guy, I had him as a kawhi mold in the draft process\n\n\nLong shot but he has the mold and attitude. Still fairly young and have a bright future.\n\n\n> You guys done with cap space? Millsap or Baynes is available.\n\nBulls never had cap space to begin with. I just crack up some numbers earlier, just to follow how AKME did all those crazy sign and trades. The Lonzo S&T was just the beginning. The DeRozan and Lauri situation was sick. I just found out like 12-13 hours ago that they were nailing the DeRozan S&T. While at the same time tendering Lauri's qualifying offer. And were just 44K below the hard cap. And these guys are juggling 8 figure salaries. The moment you go over the hard cap, you lose Lauri in free agency. Because Lauri's cap hold is $20M. Bulls front office has balls of steel. 44K was their payroll margin for error...\n\n>Lastly who\u2019s the Bulls starting 5 the first game you think?\n\nAs we speak I expect Lonzo, LaVine, DeRozan, Williams and Vooch.\n\n\nBut Bulls back court is conguested. Lonzo and LaVine starting. Then they acquired Caruso while having Coby already there. Not to mention they draft a point guard in Ayo Donsumnu. This makes me believe that Coby could be shopped. And Lauri hopefully. I'm expecting some big name in that starting PF position. Bulls might include Patrick Williams in a trade though...", "> Lavar is great, that\u2019s mostly him but he knows how to use negative attention and turn it into $.\n\nI agree. He also wants to take the heat off his sons IMO. But he just can't handle it.\n\n> And true he is a great father\n\n\ud83d\udc96\n\n> You see the vision!!! I really do believe that as well, that is the peak Pelicans. Hopefully we reach it. \n\n\nHow are Pels player development team btw? AK commented that Bulls player development team when he came in was a one man team. That's GarPax biggest short comings.\n\n\n> We have a legit future core along like other teams. \n\nI'm kinda roaming around in the west to look for teams I want to root for. And this season I pick the Pels. Because I hate people in r/nba feeding on the Pels.\n\n\nBack when Portland, Jazz, Denver, Memphis and the Spurs were rebuilding. I was following their rebuild. That's why I was not surprised by how successful they are now.\n\n\nAnd just to be plainly honest. Pels has better core than those guys have back in those days. I just can't understand why other fans don't see the potential of the Pels. Pels are one of the teams I'll be following for the next few years \n\n\n>You guys are included. Lonzo Lavine Caruso PWill And White is a great group of young guys\n\n\nThe front office assembled it. I have to give it to them. Since D.Rose, Bulls constantly don't do anything in off-season. Having this new front office kinda made me sit back and relax more \ud83e\udd23\n\n\nWhat I know is Bulls are a piece away from being a contender. And I trust AKME to land that missing piece, if it is indeed available.", "No totally, I\u2019m just giving my definition of the term. Guys like Hayes, NAW, and even Marshall should be taking a leap this year, so I think that gap could narrow.", "This is what I mean with all the awesome/giddy bullshit. Everyone lists all the small good shit but forgets to consider the huge fucking holes and get upset when people bring it up.", "I just see no vision with Griffin. Is it short term success? Is it long term? If it\u2019s long term, why have we not made moves that actually make sense? What are we waiting for? \n\nI\u2019m convinced Griffin doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s doing", "Team development is honestly pretty good man, we can never put it together. But have you seen some of those Demarcus Cousin games? He was always like that but I think he could\u2019ve reached a new level with us \n\nWe developed ADs game a ton. Lonzo has always been a sniper but LA messed with his confidence just a tiny bit. I think he got that and that UCLA 3PT ability back from being with us. \n\nNAW and Hayes are inconsistent but the flashes are there. I think we see positive development with them too\u2026 Julius randle as well, he has a very underrated year in NOLA. I think we helped him somewhat. \n\nBucks Fans made jokws in the playoffs about how Bud was ruining Jrues offense because Pelicans Jrue has a bag!! You have to watch his offensive highlights vs the blazers in the playoffs. He\u2019s a shot creator as well. It may just be offensively but yes we can for sure develop that side of the ball extremely well", "You guys are going to get that piece soon too, you\u2019re a free Agent destination team now more than the previous couple of years. Next years FA should be good I think\u2026. \n\nAnd man you have a good basketball mind so that does make me feel good about our teams outlook. I See it that way too, we have a core that can be potentially a dynasty, but obviously our floor is pretty low as well. \n\nI think the Spurs are building another core too, I  like their young guys", "Fingers crossed!", "You're deflecting. No one said there aren't larger issues within the org. I was specifically taking issue with you denying that we have young talent on the roster.", "Aight, can you list some of these holes then? That would help contribute to this discussion.", "He\u2019s just winging it and making plans as he goes, it\u2019s obvious. Zion would\u2019ve already requested a trade if we didn\u2019t have Traj. Traj is 4/4 on draft picks. Kira is the one DG drafted, it\u2019s looking like 0/1. DG hired SVG, had to fire him in less than a year. Traj hired Willie Green, the jury is out but he\u2019s already better than SVG \n\nDG should\u2019ve been fired, Traj has to make every single decision from now on or we are literally self sabotaging ourselves.", "When I see \u201cloaded with young talent\u201d I think 2 or 3 players who can become above average starters in the league. \n\nFor NAW you literally just said he\u2019s about to start his 3rd year lol. \n\nI also replied to someone else with my assessment of the young guys in this comment thread", "Sure. \n\nNAW has not shot the ball league average from the field or 3 point line, has a bad ast/to ratio, is a bit of a ball stopper, and does not have a high IQ. Decent defender and can handle the ball though. It still doesn\u2019t mask his deficiencies. \n\nJax, while he improved, is still not a floor spacer, defender or passer. He\u2019s an athletic big, and that\u2019s about it at this point.\n\nKira. I like Kira but I fail to see what he does at an above average level. He\u2019s a good athlete and defender and I like the fact that he doesn\u2019t hold on to the ball as long as NAW. He can be a good starter in the league. \n\nGraham is 26 so I don\u2019t really consider him young. He\u2019s pretty much who he is at this point.\n\nJury is still out on the rookies but they weren\u2019t even lottery picks so you should probably not expect them to be Cade Cunningham. \n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s why I think the phrase \u201cloaded with young talent\u201d is hyperbolic. That good enough?", "Fair enough mate. I agree they\u2019re not quite there yet but I\u2019m just tired of doom and gloom on this sub when there\u2019s still some hope on the horizon."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

He\u2019s now a good half court player, with his only problem now is finishing through contact, which he can get better at.

The two most valuable assets in the modern NBA are good players on rookie deals and max players who are obviously worth more than the max. Harden falls into the secondary category, though OKC clearly didn't know that when they traded him. \n\nClearly, Lonzo is not a max player. He's going to get a market rate. And whether that's good value is determined a lot by whether this growth we've seen is a sign of things to come or just contract year hustle and work that goes away later.\n\nI'm saying the Pels can not risk it being a contract year thing. Small market teams can't take that chance. You're not going to get a superstar to force his way to New Orleans. And won't get those ring chasing vets coming at a discount. You gotta hit on your signings like the Spurs used to.\n\nJust my take. I like Lonzo a lot this year.

The fact that Zo can run point unless it's PnR is telling itself....\n\nNot to mention the way he ruins momentum and offensive flow the way he tries to score and create space in the half court. \n\nThat's why he was so hype in HS, he shines in pick up type situations when he his team has the upper hand in skill and athleticism. \n\nAt the end of the day I would liken Lonzos career to Austin Rivers to where they both have an extreme talent to make impressive plays just not consistently. Streaky shooter that can run the point and cover both guards. Worst of all is they both are overpaid or will constantly be overpaid due to thier \"potential\" and neither want to come off the bench or take non-starter money. \n\nJust try and think outside of your comfort zone for a minute. It can be refreshing to have original thoughts!", "Sure. He's more covered than when he was a disaster shooting. And he's a good defender when he puts effort in. \n\nBut I'd rather the team sign some veteran shooters and vet point guards on short contracts to match up with Zion's prime coming up. That way, you're not putting all your eggs in one basket (beyond Zion who is an obvious long term signing). I've watched Lonzo since he was drafted. Guy does not play hard most of the time. Even in this contract year, you can see the gear turned way up in crunch time. He can't play that hard the whole game, of course, but there were a lot of games we could've won with more effort.", "Zion and BI are not the best two man game on the team. Not by a long shot. Getting Zion on a guard is far better than on a long wing. That's why Zo's shooting is so important. Run that PNR all day with a guard who shoots it lights out.\n\nZo's problem is he needs a lot of space to get his shot off. He's doing pretty good with the step back but ideally your guard doesn't need to do that.\n\nI like how he's playing just saying he has too many holes in his games to give him a big deal IMO. People out here talking about him getting the max. Come on.", "What other point guard in the NBA can do that without the ball in his hands?  Zion and BI are both super high usage especially in the half court.  An elite guard in the half court wouldn\u2019t make much sense for y\u2019all.  Maybe flipping lonzo for a Myles turner would be worth it, but I genuinely don\u2019t think you can find a point guard that fits y\u2019all\u2019s cornerstone players better.

I don\u2019t have the patience for him to develop I wanna win now!!!!!\u201d Like jfc, he\u2019s a sophomore player, if you were expecting him to be an all star right off the beat, you were mistaken from the start. The 20 year old plays like a 20 year old, patience my friends, patience", "Griffin is like an arrogant politician. He thinks he\u2019s just smarter than everyone. Trading back was fine, but Hayes at 8 was so dumb. So many good players available at that spot and he reaches. Why? Why would you reach when you need to rebuild a team? Successful teams reach, we are not close to being a successful team.", "What he needs to do is take that contact and use that extra push to get to the rim faster and catch pick and roll alley oops.", "He started playing basketball his senior year of high school. Before that, he was a receiver on the football team. He does what a receiver would do, because he has absolutely zero basketball instincts.", "Nothing. Except he\u2019s the most athletic center in the NBA. He\u2019s got the size and athleticism that is at a premium at that position. Oh, and for a center he\u2019s a surprisingly good FT shooter. But in terms of skill, he can\u2019t dribble, shoot, block shots, rebound, finish, position well, switch on D, set screens, or space the floor out. There will either be a lot of growing pains for a good player, or a ton of resources wasted on a bust. Either way we\u2019re in for a long few years with Hayes.", "His hands are weak too.

If someone is cutting to the rim and he has the ball, he can make the pass better than most centers I've seen, even in traffic sometimes. But his reactions and instincts are bad; unless the pass is very obvious, i.e. a blown defensive assignment, he won't spot it and may make the wrong decision.", "He can palm the ball like kawhi and mj", "jaxson hayes dribbles above his head", "lol", "What NBA skill set, outside of being tall and jumping high, has he shown to say that he has All Star potential? Being young doesn\u2019t automatically mean there is potential.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in his potential/development because he hasn\u2019t shown any sort of skill set to develop from. He can\u2019t shoot, can\u2019t put the ball on the floor, awful on defense, bad screen setter. Also, if I\u2019m going to believe in someone\u2019s potential/development they have to show some signs of improvement over a timeframe.

Of course, it helps to have playing time to be more able to understand the nuances with this stuff and to be able to reference and point at different things for him.", "I thought for sure we were gonna take Reddish at 8.

He's very similar to AD in how he got his growth spurt.", "He\u2019s never had to rely on anything but out athleticing everyone. What he needs is abnormal NBA offseason. And to properly bulk up.

So frustrating", "I actually think he has one of the worst bodies in the league for a center. He gets bullied out there by bigger players. The weight room should be his number one focus this offseason.", "He's a good FT shooter for his position. And if his IQ catches up, being tall, jumping high and hitting FTs is all he needs to be a rotation center. He was also one or the better rebounders in his rookie class, I cited this a few days ago but I think he was 4th in total rebounding rate among rookies last year.\n\nIf his free throws can translate into in-game shooting he'd have, being tall, jumping high, rebounding, FTs and can stretch the floor somewhat, basically an All-star center.\n\nHe hasn't shown as much improvement as I'd like and it's possible his IQ never catches up in which case he's a bust, but there is tons of potential there. You also have to keep in mind since COVID started his access to coaches has been extremely limited, so the thing he needs most help in, learning the game, has been denied to him. That's going to affect his growth, which likely would be a \"two steps forward one step back\" style growth in the best of circumstances.", "He has All-Star potential. Go ahead and look up Bam Adebayo\u2019s numbers from his early career. His numbers were nearly identical, with little more rebounding (Hayes\u2019 rebounding rate was greater). And we have seen development. We see him filling in lanes better in transition, getting his body between his man and the rim more, and boxing out opponents a lot more. Last year he wasn\u2019t getting bullied every possession like some people seem to think. Last year he was just as effective on D as Zion and no one is saying that Williamson has no potential on that end. Hayes hasn\u2019t shown signs yet of being a good NBA player yet, but he has shown signs of potential and improvement.", "bam adebayo. every complaint anyone has about him now were the exact same complaints all my heat fan friends and social media follows had to say about bam. now compare the rookie numbers of adebayo and hayes. the differences are minor.", "Big difference is Siakam was the 27th pick and Jaxson was the 8th pick. Sure Jax is still young, looks like he needs alot of time in the G League, and could still become a good player, but the raptors could afford to send Siakam to their g league team.", "Jax set a screen for BI in the corner with no defender in sight. Like yeah. The coaching staff needs to break it all the way down, because clearly he doesn\u2019t even know the purpose of a screen\u2014 it was one of the most embarrassing mistakes I\u2019ve seen in 20 years of watching the league. I\u2019m surprised SVG didn\u2019t have a stroke.", "And it's not like AD is known for his devastating screens.", "Sorry, must be misremembering his draft profile, it\u2019s been a minute. You\u2019re right, but regardless basketball was never a priority to him and he was never the guy spending hours in the gym working on his craft. He spent 8 months a year working on football, and played basketball during basketball season. That is a background that makes it clear that his instincts should have developed a little more though. Now I\u2019m a little more frustrated with him.", "Some wide receivers do. Position is more finesse than power.", "BI just signed an extension. Zion is on his rookie deal. We have 4 years before we need to start thinking about them maybe leaving, likely we have a lot longer. 2 years from now we will either have a good center in Jax or have moved on. \n\nOur backup center is not going to decide whether BI or Zion stay or go.", "exactly he looks so uncoordinated and flimsy", "He has a lot of developing to do and has had a pretty janky time trying to get it. If this was a normal offseason I'm sure he'd be better. But as is they are throwing him into situations where he is over his head hoping eventually he'll figure out how to swim.\n\nThe only thing that really concerned me last night developmental wise, was when NAW got him the ball right under the basket with no one ready to defend him, and he fumbled it a second and then awkwardly passed it to Zion, because he was afraid to shoot. That was wierd and worrisome.", "He is explosive and really long that Javale kind of body", "There are a lot of, and some very big, \u201cifs\u201d, in that response. For example, \u201cif his IQ catches up he can be a rotation player\u201d. He looks so far away from having NBA level IQ, that is a huge \u201cif\u201d that doesn\u2019t seem probable of coming to fruition. Given that we held the #4 pick, traded down and took him there, rotation level player would still be a massive misuse of that pick.\n\nSo FT% and rebounding rate amongst rookies are the only signs of potential that we\u2019re hanging out hats on? I\u2019m going to need to see way more than that to have any hope of him ever becoming a starting caliber player, much less anything close the All Star level.", "I really don\u2019t care what happened with Bam. There\u2019s no direct correlation between the two, and Bam is an exception, not the rule. For every Bam, there\u2019s 50 guys who looked like Hayes their rookie year and never developed. Not to say there can never be another exception, but I\u2019ll play the probabilities on what we\u2019ve seen from Hayes thus far.", "Hayes will never, ever, ever, even come close to playing the same defense Adebayo offers", "Yeah, even with how he looked last year I thought by now he\u2019s be a solid backup. Him not showing any improvement during the bubble shoulda been a red flag but in general we looked like dogshit so he got a pass for that. Hopefully he turns it around", "You are moving goalposts, my friend.", "But AD was much more than just a pogo stick when he entered the league. He clearly had great defensive instincts and a basic understanding of how to float through space and stay out of the way on offense. Jax has absolutely none of that. I'm very worried that he's more in the vein of Marquesse Chriss, who took 4 years and 4 teams to be a contributing NBA player (and even then, just a backup for a bad team).", "You are a fool if you think basketball players are more willing to take contact than football players", "I understand. Just saying shit can get old real quick watching your second string routinely blow games to the point that you have no chance at coming back. As we have seen in the past, contracts aren\u2019t everything.", "Except he\u2019s 2.5 inches shorter than Javale and 20 pounds lighter", "Yeah, most lottery players don't work out for the team that made the pick. There are a lot of big ifs for everyone developing in the league. Getting two rotation guys for the 4th pick is fine, especially in a draft where the guy actually picked 4th is like only a rotation piece. \n\nIt's 100% possible he never gets the game and is a bust. But waiving away the things he's actually done well to make a point about how he has \"no NBA skills\" is disengenuis at best.", "That\u2019s why I said all-star potential, not all-star certainty. If a million guys all had the same profile, and only one makes the all-star game, they all had all-star potential, but only one could capitalize on it. At least, that\u2019s what I mean when I say potential.", "Hayes blocks more shots per 36 minutes than Bam and he\u2019s nowhere close to done developing as a shot blocker. He put up more defensive win shares per 36, more offensive win shares per 36, more win shares per 36, more VORP per 36, and 0.1 fewer total VORP than Bam his rookie year. Hayes\u2019 career BLK% is 4.3% to Bam\u2019s 3.3%, while Bam\u2019s STL% is 1.6% to Hayes\u2019 1.1%. Their defense will be very similar, as Hayes continues to improve his positioning on defense and gets more involved as a rim protector. The biggest difference between the two is playmaking and rebounding, because while Hayes is a below average playmaker, Bam came in as above average and is now the second best playmaker at the position (to Jokic obviously). Hayes will never come close to Bam there. Bam also had more rebounds per 36 and a higher rebound rate every year of his career than Hayes. Of course this has very little to do with defense. As long as Hayes puts in the work, he could be anything from where he is now to better than Bam on D.", "No one is saying Hayes is AD. Hayes just had a very similar growth spurt to AD and so is very new to his position. He was always a prospect pick.\n\nGo read the pre draft scouting reports on this. Everything you're saying was already known then. The hope is SVG with his defensive focus will be able to teach Hayes on that end. Not having an off season is really hard when you've got a new coach and all new philosophy. I'm not looking for a lot early on from Hayes. Next year after a real off season and two years in the league will be a much better idea of where he's at.", "Hayes will never ne AD yes. And it's possible he will bust. But for now I'm not too worried and I'm fine with him getting more minutes than he totally deserves because he needs to develop or fail, that won't happen if he stays on the bench.\n\nHe looks a little less lost every time he goes out there and that makes me hopeful. But it's going to be a long process and that's totally fine. Getting the 10th seed and being in the play-in game, with visible substantive improvements coming from 3/4, of Kira, NAW, Hayes and Zion is massive success this season. \n\nHell, if we win only 20 games but all 4 have visible improvement this year that's a win in my book. Though I don't see that happening, we are too good, SVG is too good and I don't think Kira will get all that much play.\n\nI hate watching us lose, but ultimately as long as we see player development I'm ok with it.", "Yeah IMO when AD came out he was the best prospect since LeBron. Hayes is not that but he might have been the top prospect available. If I knew he had the work ethic to succeed I\u2019d be more confident. I\u2019m concerned that he\u2019s gonna let his ego get in the way of his ability to hone his craft. Remember the Rising Stars Challenge rant?", "I'd be more concerned about everyone else off the bench absolutely playing garbage and our entire teams halfcourt offense being bad before I worry about Jax though. I think both will improve with time. \n\nBecause of the short offseason this team, and the rest of the league, is in this wierd pre-season, regular season zone that's producing wierd results. I don't think that's Jaxson's problem, but I do think that's why JJ can't buy a bucket, Melli is missing wide open shots and NAW was our only bench player to score in the first half. \n\nIf JJ, Hart and Bledsoe improve on offense and our halfcourt sets start working we really don't have too much to worry about Jax's developmental minutes. They will keep us from making a splash in the playoffs, but we aren't contending even if we replace those minutes with someone unattainable like Aaron Baynes.\n\nIf our backup center causes BI and/or Zion to force their way out, they were always going to leave.", "And 12 years younger, he has time to bulk up", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s disingenuous at all, I think we just differ on how impressive being a \u201cgood FT shooter for his position\u201d and \u201cbetter rebounder in his rookie class\u201d are. Those are a lot of qualifiers in order to make your point. A \u201ctallest midget\u201d type of accomplishment", "Lol, well by that logic 95% of all players drafted have All Star potential as I\u2019m sure you can find a similar profile of a once AS player with every incoming rookie.", "I think we agree and are just misreading each other. I know the original plan was to have Jaxson basically no NBA minutes last year and purely focus on developing, but then injuries fucked up that plan.\n\nI agree, this year will be rough for Hayes and that's ok, we aren't winning a title anyways, so lets see some development minutes.", "Yeah, players should be assessed based on their peers. The \"tallest midget\" sounds unimpressive, unless you're in a \"tallest midget\" competition then it is exactly what you need.\n\nAgain he may bust, but there's no real indication that he's heading down that path. I think BBIQ is one of the easiest skills to develop, it'll happen with experience. Yeah he'll never be a Rondo, but even a JaVale McGee level BBIQ is enough for him to have an impact and that's well within reach.", "Yeah, but Hayes isn\u2019t an incoming rookie. If I was comparing their college numbers, Adebayo\u2019s were way better. But Hayes crept up to him in his first year in the league. So, if anything, he\u2019s developing faster than Bam. He could go out this season and put up identical sophomore numbers too, and you\u2019ll have the same response, so at this point I think we\u2019re splitting hairs, so I\u2019ll leave you with this: he\u2019s got a year of league play under his belt that before four games ago everyone (for the most part) on here agreed was promising. This is largely recency bias that\u2019s getting him killed on here IMO.", "No real indication he\u2019s heading down the path of a bust? I think we\u2019re just too far away on our evaluation of Hayes, so I\u2019ll just agree to disagree.", "Dude. You can\u2019t declare players as busts until their third year. \n\nIt\u2019s basically Scouting 101.", "Dude.

There\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll get the next superstar in a draft and seeing how the league is, one isn\u2019t enough anymore. Which is why i don\u2019t want the lakers to go all out for AD bc without other key pieces around, they\u2019re not gonna get it done, especially with an older lebron.

Also I doubt Kyrie is leaving but if he is, Ainge will probably still make an offer with better draft picks + Taytum. Raptors imo have a pretty compelling offer, giving away picks + JV + OG + Siakim/Ibaka and depending on if Kahwi leaves those picks could be good. Not to mention the Clippers who just traded for a boatload of future assets ", "Lmao, that\u2019s irrelevant within the context of the argument. You suggested that lonzo being out was a reason for last night\u2019s game against the pacers being such a pathetic embarrassment. \n\nHis \u201cceiling\u201d or potential is irrelevant within that context, and you bringing it up actually detracts from your argument ", "I really don\u2019t think AD wants to sign in Boston, but you\u2019re right, who knows. \n\nHow high are you on Taytum? I think he\u2019s slightly better than BI. Better, but not by an insane amount. I think he\u2019s being overvalued in these discussions but frankly I don\u2019t watch much of him. \n\nRaptors and Clippers are definitely interesting. Clippers could technically make an offer now though, so I don\u2019t know why they would wait.  I\u2019m not convinced that either of their packages are better than what the Lakers are offering though. \n\n", "The loss to the pacers has more to do with the mental state of having literally our entire team on the trading block.

Maybe the Clippers if you wanna really try and sell it? There\u2019s a reason they\u2019ve lost to the good teams with winning records.\n\nFor example, they\u2019ve lost to the Lakers who have a winning record since their trades and beat a Clippers team that actually has a losing record since the trades they\u2019ve made. This is why I said their wins are misleading and have given the fans false hope which has been under a very favorable home games", "Not quite back to A but much much closer to it than B.", "The Pelicans have had a 58.8% winning percentage since March 1. That's around 21% of the season.\n\nYou can dismiss it, but all you're doing is confirmation bias. \n\nThey lost tonight. If they can't beat the 3 seed in the West right now, I'm disappointed, but not shocked.", "This is not confirmation bias and you didn\u2019t even address my question. Look at what\u2019s happening right now against Memphis. You think they\u2019ve had actual quality wins against good teams?", "Funny thing is, everyone was doom and gloom before the Houston-Charlotte stretch and I was 100% certain people would start doing backflips from them beating glorified g-league teams before they ever played them. \n\nI\u2019ve debated how I want this season to end, because I don\u2019t want Griffin to have any excuse to not make major changes to this roster and coaching staff this offseason.", "They beat the Clippers twice by a combined 28 points. That's two quality wins. All their other wins are against NBA teams that have pretty much all beat playoff teams recently. \n\nYou dismissing over a fifth of the season because you don't like the specific wins is insane."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

While he's been immensely frustrating in the past, his major issues were fixable and I believed in him, and he's been so much better the past month or so. Watching him combine his skills of hustle and fearlessness with some decent passes and playmaking (rather than selfishly trying to get all the layups and 3s the second the ball gets into his hand) made me so proud of him.\n\nNo matter what, he always brings hustle, and he never lets a \"big\" player like Lebron freak him out or mess with his head, which is a super valuable trait.

This team blows it out of the water", "As a Westbanker I'd be so angry if I could read", "Yeah, I was kinda freaked out.  I hadn't seen this team play like that in a long long time.  They came out and got smacked around.  Unbelievable to see them turn that game in the 2nd half.  The team really has something here.  It is amazing to see the shift.", "So much time to outfit plan and that's what he came up with. The mind and eyes boggle", "What LA does to a mf...", "SOMETHIN BOUT THE PICK AND ROLL", "THIS MY LIFE, DO WHAT I WANT, I BE WITH DIFFERENT HOES \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc71\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd5\ud83c\udffd", "I feel you. I\u2019m from the UK, have no connection with this team before I decided to support them. Main reason I picked them was for the young core and I wanted to see them progress. I\u2019ve made the right choice", "I'm glad we did it but they got a ring out of it lol its not like they lost the trade. It was the definition of a \"win now\" trade.", "Andrew \u2018fraudulent all star\u2019 wiggins scored only 23/2/0 in 10 more minutes if play \n\nDefinitely deserving of all nba as well", "Before boogie got injured that team was fun as fuck too", "West Bank is the Best Bank.", "Oh this made laugh!", "While I don't think they lost the trade, they definitely didn't make it thinking that win now, was just one shortened season that finished in a Disney park without fans or a parade.\n\nThey are definitely still in the win now period they thought they bought.", "Win now but they're screwed after that one ring. Meanwhile, Pels stacked, Lakers fucked.", "The Lakers had 16 rings going into that season. One COVID ring for one of the premiere franchises in the NBA is not worth what the Lakers gave up. Not to mention, their franchise will be crippled for years to come because of that trade.", "Actually about half the  lakers fans regret the trade themselves. They don\u2019t find much joy in winning the bubble title that was designed for them to win. They hate that they lost the baby lakers and Bi in particular.", "I think it comes down to expectations of the trade for a team like the Lakers. You got Lebron James and you trade for a relatively young AD expecting to get more than one chip. Also don't underestimate just how much the Lakers and their fanbase despises the fact that Boston had one chip on them for so long. Getting just one ties them with the Celtics but they're in free fall right now and Boston is ascending with the likes of Tatum, Brown, Timelord and they got a hell of a coach in Udoka.\n\nSo while it was a \"win now\" trade the Lakers expected that window te be long enough to win multiple if not at least 2 championships. The one they got is just enough for them to save face over the fact that they literally gave up the farm, the house, the kids, the estate, and damn near anything that wasn't bolted down to get this.\n\nHell they can't even start properly rebuilding until at least 3 more years. Also as much as people say the stars want to go play in LA lets not forget that prior to Lebron's arrival they Fakers were effectively the laughing stock of the league. Feel free to look up what went down when they were trying to recruit Lamarcus Aldridge. Without Dr. Buss that franchise is in free fall at this point.", "Damn right only difference is this is a team of young guys and the other was vets\n\nThis one we\u2019ve seen them grow and have highs n lows and they will NEVER stop fighting. Think that\u2019s why I love em so much", "Only in they heads Lmao. I\u2019d rather go to Hibernia", "Keep telling y\u2019all selves that", "Yeah they definitely thought they\u2019d get more successful years out of the AD/LeBron duo for sure. Would\u2019ve been absolutely disastrous if they didn\u2019t win that ring", "Fans are idiots. Half of our fans have been dragging Griff for the same trade. Sometimes both teams win the trade.   It's ok.", "Yeah I definitely like this team more, even though Jrue was my original G. Too many likeable homegrown guys"], "CommentLinkTitles": []}
