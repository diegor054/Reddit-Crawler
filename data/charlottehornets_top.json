{"Title": "Playoffs here we come ...", "PostID": "4ey6k1", "CreatedUTC": 1460746095.0, "UpVotes": 2843, "UpVotesRatio": 0.93, "PostURL": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/4ey6k1/playoffs_here_we_come/", "PermaLink": "/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/4ey6k1/playoffs_here_we_come/", "SelfText": "Playoffs are right around the corner and a lot of people, including you guys, have noticed we have a really special team here. Having had a wide range of experiences playing basketball my whole life, I've always believed that basketball is the most fun when everyone buys in and plays for each other. That's what has helped our team this season and it has also made playing on the court really enjoyable. So this post is dedicated to my teammates.\n\nFor us, it all started on our preseason trip to China. We really bonded there and clicked as a group off the court and I think it has carried onto the court. So what I thought I would do is talk a little bit about each teammate.\n\nJorge Guti\u00e9rrez: He just joined the team, so I haven't been able to spend as much time with him, but Jorge is slowly getting more comfortable around the team. He played ball at Cal so we've talked about how awesome California is. He's also talked about how when he's done playing, he wants to spend time working with underprivileged children in Mexico...gotta respect that!!\n\nTyler Hansbrough: I call him T-Hans or Psycho T. I think he has the best one-liners of anyone on the team. When I first met him, I didn't know what to expect, but this dude works really, really hard and has the most hilarious and unexpected one-liners. He's also the one person on the team I'd never want to fight.\n\nAl Jefferson: Funniest person on the team and candidate for funniest teammate I've ever had. When Al talks or laughs, everybody listens, partially because he's going to say something hilarious and partially because he talks hella loud. I sit right in front of him on the bus, so when he talks, I need to turn my music volume all the way up. Al is also the most generous person ever and has a great heart! Many people say they want to win, but Al genuinely just wants to win. He has sacrificed so much for our team and been all-in for the team.\n\nFrank Kaminsky: Man...this rookie is so crazy. You never know what he's going to say or do. He's always keeping us on our toes and doing unexpected things (i.e. the dance-off in China). Tank (his nickname) is going to be a great player because he's just so skilled. He's also the team's designated Chipotle runner as well as Al's personal Jimmy John's courier. His locker is next to mine, so needless to say, I've lost quite a few brain cells having so many conversations with him in the locker room.\n\nAaron Harrison: We call him Twin. I'm not sure if Twin spoke the first 4 weeks of training camp, but since then he has started opening up. I also think he's going to be really good because he works hard, he pays attention and tries to constantly learn. We don't often scrimmage because of our game schedule, but recently Aaron has been playing well in scrimmages and picking up a ton of tricks just from watching certain guys during the games. I've been impressed by how much he has learned. Sometimes I make fun of Twin, but he just looks at me awkwardly and doesn't say anything, so I don't make fun of him that much anymore lol.\n\nTroy Daniels: If Al wasn't on the team, this dude would be the funniest dude. Me and Troy go back to Houston when he made the game-winning shot in a playoff game right after getting called up from the D-League. Whenever Troy gets subbed into the game, he scores right away. It's unbelievable. The thing I'm most impressed with about Troy is his confidence in his own shot. He never ever gets down on himself or stops shooting, so I've learned a lot just by watching his mindset and how he approaches basketball. On behalf of the human population, we also would like to thank Troy for recently using Invisalign. We all know he needs it...\n\nNic Batum: Slick Nic. If Nic and Twin were put in the same room, it would be complete silence. Nic barely ever talked early on, but after he got comfortable, I started realizing how funny he is. Obviously on the court, he has enjoyed an unbelievable breakout year and he's so fun to play with because he can make plays in so many different ways. He is the most laid back person ever. Sometimes, he shows up to practice on a Segway lol. He's on the other side of me in the locker room, so when I'm sick of having childish conversations with Tank, I turn to the other side and have refined conversations with Nic.\n\nCody Zeller: This dude runs and jumps like a gazelle. It's crazy. He's also wildly popular in Indiana and very calm and stable. When Coach gets on Cody it's the funniest thing, because Cody has no expression, response or anything. He just sits there and we're all wondering what Cody is thinking. But then he just comes out and plays super hard. Cody loves sandwiches like me, so on the road, I always ask him where the best and nearest sandwich spots are.\n\nMarvin Williams: We call him Marv. He will be tied with Jared Jeffries for the best teammate I have ever had. He's the most genuinely nice and polite person ever, seriously. He says \"sir\" a lot when talking to us, he always asks us about our families and takes care of everyone. He gives his per diem (which adds up to a lot of money) to Twin just out of generosity. In my opinion, Marv is the voice of our team and our glue guy. He also anchors our D.\n\nKemba Walker: Kemba is the most down-to-earth dude. I was really impressed when I first met him and he has totally handled his well-deserved success this season with such grace. When we're all hanging out, you would never know he is our star player. First off, he's like 6-12 inches shorter than everybody. Secondly, he always wears a backpack as big as him, so he looks like a middle schooler on the first day of school...it's hilarious! He plays with everything he has every night and has carried us on his back for many games.\n\nCourtney Lee: CLee. I've known him since Houston, where we first originated our handshake. Courtney has been a huge, huge addition for us since MKG has been hurt. Courtney and I love talking trash and starting shooting competitions with each other, and he's always been a great guy on and off the court. I was excited when we got him after the trade deadline.\n\nMichael Kidd-Gilchrist: Mike. I feel bad for him because he has had some bad luck with injuries, but this guy works incredibly hard and plays soooo hard. People would knock him for his jumper in the past, but if you knew anything about basketball, you would realize how good MKG really is defensively AND offensively. I love playing with this guy and we established a good on-court connection early on since he was always cutting for open layups. He's gonna come back strong and be an absolute beast.\n\nJeremy Lamb: We call him JLamb. He gets my vote for best dancer on the team. JLamb is really laid back and has that California personality even though he's not from there. He's so talented and will be a big time player. For the first part of the season, JLamb and I were playing really well off each other, and he has really helped take some pressure off of me and the second unit. He's also a bball junkie, so you might see him at the arena getting shots up late at night.\n\nSpencer Hawes: Spence or the Needle are his nicknames. We often talk about how awesome the West Coast is and Spence is also a huge foodie, so we always talk about restaurants at the cities we go to. My favorite food is sushi so Spence has been someone I can talk to about sushi, since a lot of my teammates don't eat raw fish. We've enjoyed some nice meals on the road, and of course, he is my hair mentor.\n\nHopefully that helps you guys get to know us a little bit better as a team. I think we have a really special group and we are ready to give the playoffs our all.

Specifically, Lin always played IMO very well for every team he's been with, but for some reason, the media is lauding him more these days.  Maybe it's because Lin is getting paid relatively little money to play for Hornets, or maybe it's because Hornets BB fans are classier, I don't know.  Stat wise, Lin is not having all that great year, but I do think he's enjoying his teammates the most, in contrast to the Kobe-centric Lakers and Rockets whose fan site Clutchfans still allow postings viciously cutting down their former player Lin who has done nothing but played hard and unselfishly for Rockets.  You can see how well Lin actually played next to Harden when you compare how badly Ty Lawson played next to Harden.  It's not even comparable.  \n\nAnyway, I do hope Lin stays with Hornets after Hornets give Lin a better contract.  I think he will stay with Hornets UNLESS another team offers him an opportunity to start as a PG.  To me, Lin as a starting SG is pretty ok, but as a starting PG, Lin can average 17/7 for the season in 34 minutes per game.\n\nP.S.

Don't be a hater", "Playoffs are right around the corner and a lot of people, including you guys, have noticed we have a really *special* team here. Having had a wide range of experiences playing basketball my whole life, I've always believed that basketball is the most fun when everyone gives me the ball and gets out of the way. That's what has helped our team this season and it has also made playing on the court really enjoyable. So this post is dedicated to my teammates.\n\nFor us, it all started on our preseason trip to other cities in Amercian and not somewhere cool like China. We really bonded and clicked as a group off the court and I think it has carried onto the court. So what I thought I would do is talk a little bit about each teammate.\n\nCorey Brewer: Clumsiest person on the team and candidate for clumsiest teammate I've ever had. When Brewbrew walks on stairs or is doing agility drills everybody takes a quick glances over in his direction, partially because he's probably going to engage in bedazzling contortions and partially because we want to be able to rush over and help if it's serious. Brewbrew is also the most generous person ever and has a great heart! Many people say they want to win, but Brewbrew is always the most drenched after practice due to the fact that his drills mostly involve flying down the full length of the court while evading multiple defenders for that sweet lay in at the end.\n\nMichael Beasley: I call him Bees-mobile. I think is the chillest dude on the team. When I first met him, I didn't know what to expect, but this dude works really, really hard and at taking it easy and having a good team. I'm not sure how he stays so relaxed all the time, hopefully he shares the secret with me soon xDD\n\nPatrick Beverley: If Bees-mobile wasn't on the team, this dude would be the most chill dude. Me and Patpat have been playing together now for awhile and he always comes through and makes the right plays when it matters most (giving me the ball lol). Whenever Troy gets subbed out of the game, he takes a quick nap. It's unbelievable. The thing I'm most impressed with about Patpat is his confidence that my shot will always go in. He never ever gets down on me or stops passing, so I've learned a lot just by watching his mindset and how he approaches basketball.\n\nDwight Howard: We call him Howie. He will be tied with Durant for the best teammate I have ever had. He's the most genuinely nice and polite person ever, seriously. Besides making sure everyone is having a good time during practice with his goofy antics, he always asks us about our families and takes care of everyone. In my opinion, Howie is the voice of our team and our glue guy. He also anchors our D.\n\nJosh Smith: J-Smoove. I was looking forward to playing against him after he single-handily Slay'd the clippers last season and then signed with the Clippers as part of a secret double agent plan Coach had planned but that all went south when the Clippers figured it out and got rid of him. Welcoming him has been great tho since he's a tremendous player and keeps Howie happy off the court.\n\nJames Harden: Harden is the most down-to-earth dude. I was really impressed when I first looked in a mirror and he has totally handled his well-deserved success this season with such grace. When we're all hanging out, you would never know he is our star player. First off, he has this really hobo-esque beard thing going on. Secondly, he always wears a chef hat while doing a cooking motion even when he's doing something not related to cooking like a sport that involves throwing balls through hoops...it's hilarious! He plays with everything he has every night and has carried us on his back for every game this season.\n\nHopefully that helps you guys get to know us a little bit better as a team.

In today\u2019s world of basketball, it makes you really different, because the things that society values aren\u2019t necessarily in line with what God values\u2026 We should be humble, and understand that everything that is good comes from God.\n\nWell if that's true and God is the great creator then he also created everything that is evil as well. Lin thinks he knows what God values because he was called to be a Christian. I guess his idea of being humble includes thinking you're better than everyone else. It was also stated that Lin won't share any political beliefs he has and plans to be a pastor when he is finished with basketball. Not being willing to state your beliefs on basic political and social structure but boasting you do everything for God and plan to teach the Bible is about as ignorant as you can get.\n\nHe can bounce a ball real good but the kid is a pro-life, bible-study, real-issue dodging simpleton and parents should think twice before letting their kids idolize any pro baller especially one who thinks the earth is 6000 years old. \n\nWhen someone won't share their beliefs or whom they support politically it means one of two things, either they are embarrassed about their beliefs and allegiances or they don't know shit and can't support it.

Lin is 4th overall in scoring and just points away from 2 players (Batum and Williams) who started ahead of him.  This is why a Lin-led bench with Al was top 9 in scoring in the NBA while the starters are just 22nd.  A huge part of Charlotte's success was their bench!

Their starter jackets were ubiquitous all over the country.  Larry Johnson and Mugsey Bogues were in Space Jam.  They were consistent contenders even though they never broke through - although it's hard to fault them in the MJ era east.

A 3x all-star, franchise leader in minutes (20,607), field goals (4,164), 3pt field goals (1,283), free throws (2,398), points (12,009), offensive win shares (31.3), win shares (48.5), and value over replacement player (23.2). These numbers show your hard work and dedication. You worked two times harder than anyone in this franchise ever has. After being drafted in 2011 you embraced this city with open arms and made Charlotte your home. You took a 7-59 team, which was the worst team in NBA history, and took them to the playoffs.... twice. You're the reason we became relevant. You poured your heart out to this city, we felt your impact not just on the court, but off of it. Off the court you can't get a better guy. This is a guy who genuinely cares about tje community and wants to make a difference. Thats a huge reason why it's such a big loss for us Charlotte fans. He truly cares about the fans and teammates. He is the most down to earth guy in the world. From mentoring young kids to the numerous amount of charity works everyone in Charlotte watched and took notice of how you genuinely cared about the city. You didnt do it for the cameras, you did it out of the kindness of your heart. Off the court, your invaluable and will not and can not be replaced. The heart and determination you played with inspired us, it gave us hope. From carrying us to 20 point comebacks in the 4th quarter, running around all over on defense, drawing charge after charge, playing whole games and second halves, you laid everything out on the court. We know you wanted to be here. Coming out and saying you will take less to remain with a team is something you just dont do. But 61 million less? We dont blame you for leaving. It showed us how loyal and how much you care. Were sorry our incompetent front office and ownership failed you. We will be there to give you the full house standing ovation you deserve.

All the fake love is gonna piss me off.", "Ok. I doubt he just one track mined the Celtics. We have no idea.", "Only meeting with one team doesn't mean he hasn't weighed his options.

I hate that a bad owner, bad front office, and having 5 free agents at the worst possible offseason got us in this mess.

Please dont lump an entire fanbase together celtics fans dont agree on much.", "Forget ground beef. Kemba's more or less had straight pig balls as a supporting cast.

He\u2019s tall too! \n\nBut seriously, I do kind of like him as a prospect", "so having 2 is necessary, no?", "Why? On paper this draft is one of the poorer ones in terms of top end superstar, franchise altering talent.\n\nIt would make sense to trade down and get more assests.

He ruins their general managers & over steps at every turn.", "Problem is, it's largely a transplant city. People are already fans of other teams when they get there.", "I don\u2019t know what players but I would imagine they would want playoff veterans- a big to do battle with the Lakers bigs and somebody who can guard LeBron/Kawhi in next years playoffs.", "Would Chicago trade Lauri and #4 to move up?", "Steven Adams", "If I'm Mitch I'm pushing hard for Wiggins + #2 for Batum + #3.  Locks in either Wiseman or Edwards for us, and GS can still trade out of #3 to the Knicks or some other clowns who want LaMelo.  Batum fits their positionless style and they get the cap relief after this season.  We have the cap room to try to rehab Wiggins with no risk.  Wiseman-PJ-Wiggins-Rozier-Devonte with Bridges, Monk, and the Martins off the bench would be a solid young group.", "Compared to who we might get for our pick(s) and our $17M trade exception, Wiseman may actually be the best option even in a win-now timeline. I don't think that we'd trade Wiggins or Draymond unless Giannis demands a trade to Golden State or we can somehow swing the pick(s) + Draymond for Embiid. So that doesn't really leave many players on the table to play the 4/5 for us.", "Huh. I had no idea", "Me too dude", "if we have any faith in our existing backcourt theres no way we can take ball, id rather reach on avdija or okongwu we need bigs.", "Did I just see a community reference on a hornets post?

Ball could be transcendent. It\u2019s a 50/50 proposition but I would take my shot on that. A middling franchise in a less desirable market needs to gamble sometimes. Ball would be a gamble that I could get behind.", "They can also play together, Devonte is pretty good off ball and Lamelo can make up for his defensive weaknesses and guard wing players (he\u2019s 6\u20197\u201d with a 6\u201910\u201d wingspan)", "In the warriors subreddit the general consensus seems to be that he wouldn't be a good fit so they might pass on him.", "Then we take Ball. I expect the Warriors to trade the second pick so it's kind of up in the air who actually goes in that spot. Edwards should be off the board at 1 though. We're in a position to get one of the three actually good prospects in this draft, it's phenomenal", "The problem there is Mike is an idiot and we signed Terry for too much money.  We might have to bend over in order to get rid of him.", "Would we really want Graham to be our starting 2 guard though? He so small to me", "For six games.  Then we run out Hernangomez, I guess.", "Who would you take at 3?", "lol no this draft is weak af", "\\#4 + Lauri for #3 is insanely not worth it for us", "So hornets get a draft upgrade and a better player. Quite the logic!", "Any interest in Gallinari? Steven Adams? Myles Turner? Vucevic? Aldridge? Nurkic? Valanciunas? Tobias Harris? Al Horford? Jarrett Allen? Not saying all those guys are def available, just curious.\n\nI don't think Giannis and Embiid level players are realistic targets, but maybe guys who are fringe All-Stars might be doable.", "I've heard the Giannis trade scenario thrown out before, but I'd never heard Embiid floated before. I can't see Philly making that move but their front office is pretty terrible so anything could happen. I guess I haven't thought much about the warriors actually needing depth at a position in a while, makes sense.", "Yeah I agree, I wouldn\u2019t be mad at all if we just roll the dice on ball. If he sucks, whatever, but if he\u2019s great we\u2019re competing for the 8th seed in 2021", "I wont say 50/50 on Ball being that good.", "that\u2019s crazy to me. he\u2019d fit so well with that team but i guess they need more of a rebounding center", "That would be foolish of them. Get a guy who by year two could be a 15/10 player in the paint on a rookie contract? Sounds perfect for them.", "The Warriors can\u2019t afford to trade that pick. They have too many current players getting paid. They can\u2019t take on another big salary. Wiseman could become a stud by 2022 and Curry and Thompson will still be capable for another year or two when that happens.", "On a positive note, his contact was frontloaded and it's only for two more years. And we're out Batum's stupid contract next year. My thought is draft Ball, and let Monk/Rozier fight for their places.", "He can guard the 1 on defense. Just have Ball get more playmaking duties.", "Wiseman is ideal if he's there.  Past that I'd try really hard to trade out, but if no good option pops up there then Edwards is a fine consolation prize.  Really I think the best options are all guys we could trade back and still get though.", "I was curious about Chicago doing that to pick #2. Even then you probably right, but would you do it for Edwards or Ball? \n\nBasically trying to dream up a scenario where we get Wiseman at #3.", "Yes, and GSW gets the cap relief, that is the price they pay for it.", "Hate to be the pessimist, but the Sixers are not dumping Embiid for a guy they would be praying would basically turn into something resembling Embiid in four years (but very likely won't be) and an over the hill Draymond. You don't trade a sure thing for a shot in the dark in those circumstances.", "If he\u2019s great the Hornets are competing for a 5/6 seed. The East is about to hit a lot of turmoil. I\u2019ll be conservative and say Giannis stays, but Philly, Miami, and Indiana are all peaking as playoff teams in their current iteration. Orlando doesn\u2019t have a sound direction. \n\nBrooklyn and Boston will be great, as will the Bucks if Giannis stays. Toronto probably remains relevant because of how well-coached they are. After that? It\u2019s open. A guy like Ball has a 30 percent chance to hit his ceiling, but if he does, he\u2019s gonna get that team to a 5/6 seed in short order. I want him in the teal and purple.", "Yay", "I think the idea is they'd trade the pick with one of their large salaries, possibly Wiggins, so it wouldn't impact their books that much compared to their current situation", "Yeah Rozier\u2019s contract is short enough it shouldn\u2019t be a prohibitive factor. \n\nBut this is the Hornets we\u2019re talking about so I\u2019m worried", ">  And we're out Batum's stupid contract next year\n\nthat thing's still going??", "The only person in the draft I really want is wiseman. As happy as I am to jump to 3rd this is the worst draft to do it", "Ya still might man. GSW is whats stopping you there", "You really need to rethink your comment, I wasn't complimenting you. Your trade makes no sense,Wiggins might have a net negative contract but he is still a productive player. Warriors have that contract for a sign and trade for the future,to match salaries for a star player.", "But the #2 pick could be anything... It could even be another embiid", "\u201cOver the hill\u201d? Dude just turned 30. Overall I agree with your point of view here though.", "Ah okay. Well I didn\u2019t consider that...interesting.\n\nWhat team wants to take on Wiggins, though? He\u2019s tied in til 2023 from what I understand. Plus he sort of oddly could fit in with that team as a Harrison Barnes-type.", "Depends. If he accepts his massive player option, then yes, he's set for a big payday this year. If he declines, he's a free agent, but will likely make a fraction of his current contract, if he even gets picked up. Or the Hornets could buy him out. Obviously the best for Charlotte is not in line with what's best for him. I mean, if you could get 27 million for sitting on the bench for a season, wouldn't you?", "I don't need to rethink it, I meant what I said.  GSW gets significant earlier cap relief, and Batum, as much shit as he gets, is a much better complimentary player than Wiggins in GSW's system.  Better defender, better passer, and can play whatever position they need him to.  Assuming everyone else comes back healthy, GSW doesn't need another scorer or ball-dominant player.  For them, Batum fits better than Wiggins, plus the cap relief.  Hence giving up the draft spot.", "I think he\u2019s past his peak but open to arguments that I\u2019m wrong on that.", "Maybe the two pick, Minn 2021 pick, and Andrew Wiggins for Bradley Beal? \n\nOr maybe the same for Ben Simmon?", "Even with all the fit issues, I don't think Philly moves Simmons this summer, and not for anything else than a package that would make them on paper the best Eastern team. \n\nBeal is interesting, my guess is that Washington wants to see him and Wall play together before doing anything, with the idea they could always trade Beal at the deadline or next offseason. \n\nGoing through the league though, I'm struggling to find someone who's:  \n\n\n* good enough now for the Warriors to pursue \n  \n* available, or whose team could take the gamble on a supercharged rebuild \n  \n* from a team who would not mind strengthening the Warriors (kinda like NOP didn't care about LAL getting Davis because they're not on the same timeline)"], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

They were never as bad as their record made it appear", "People need to have some perspective. It\u2019s a 5 game winning streak. We are still the 4th worst team in the league, and even if some winning continues, we aren\u2019t threatening for 5th.

They had lost David Robinson due to injury. The odds of laying in the top pig were next to nothing and yet they did, and they got Tim Duncan. So you got to pair Tim Duncan with David Robinson and the rest is history. But the point is they took advantage of a terrible situation in the end. It really paid off for them.\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to say the San Antonio tanked that season in order to get Duncan. \n\nI think Jordan is concerned that the Fanbase will not show up and continue to support the team if they were that awful. And I think that may be one of the things that hold us back from really trying to tank with any real effort.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is even with all that San Antonio was still in the top 10 in attendance in 1996.

Tanking continuously ruined development for young players taken with high picks, ruined the team vibe and dynamics. And what's funny is besides DeAndre Ayton, literally none of the key Suns players now were brought in due to tanking. Booker was picked 13th. Bridges was picked 10th (via a pick traded, same draft as Ayton). Chris Paul was traded due to trading away a player acquired via trading a FA acquisition (traded Kelly Oubre, acquired via trading Trevor Ariza) and also by trading away a player acquired via free agency off trading away a player drafted via a non-tank pick of 15th for cap space (Ricky Rubio, acquired via free agency off trading T.J. Warren away for cap space, which looked bad at the time and looks bad in a vacuum but it helped in the long-run in a weird way). \n\nThe players the Suns took with tank picks save for Ayton - Alex Len with the 5th pick, Dragan Bender with the 4th pick, Marquesse Chriss with the 8th pick, Josh Jackson with the 4th pick - all struggled and their struggles can be attributed with playing for a team without an identity save losing and tanking.\n\nThe only time I can understand tanking is when you've already got an established core of players - whether veterans or young players - and when there is an injury to a key player or two that makes your team non-competitive for that season. Basically what the Spurs did with David Robinson out to get Tim Duncan or what the Warriors did the year before they drafted Harrison Barnes.", "Ticket prices, which will be among the highest in the league, and PSLs, which literally no other team has.

Investing in your internal draft evaluation personnel seems like a better path.\n\nGlad to see the Suns doing well again.

Same with the Sixers.\n\nI'm not saying tanking is worth it, because I'm truly not sure what the answer to that question is.\n\nAll I know is that being in position to draft the core we have now (which we got with a lil luck), has made a lot of the past shitty seasons we've had worth it in my eyes, just because when you've been eating shit for decades, the wins taste so much sweeter.\n\nObviously I would've liked for us to get our shit together sooner, but we're at this place where we're truly having fun with it due to how we did in the past, and I've come to terms and accepted that.", "Ah got it, maybe they'll figure it out at some point.", "Whaaat who are we farming then?\n\nEdit: nvm Chicago Wolves?!? Wtf", "No, I was with u/TropangTexter for those Suns years, and the only thing it got them was Deandre Ayton, and that was after like 5 tries.

We gave up a record number of three pointers last year because Cliff couldn't adjust his defensive schemes to not collapse the paint as hard, leaving shooters wide open on the perimeter. We were getting lit up in December but nothing in our game plan adapted and we got crushed because of it after Cody went down among other things. \n\nI expect Cliff to put out a great team because he is good at creating a plan when his old one fails as long as he has months to evaluate and change the roster.

My only suggestion would be MJ crying emoji as the eye of Sauron and Kupchak on Gollum", "If you believe people can never change and learn from their mistakes, this is an awful hire. I kind of get the impression that Mitch told Clifford that he expects him to work with our younger talent and give them playing time. Or we can all sit here and look at how he did in the past with us and Orlando but this is last second chance at a job and I think you\u2019re not going to see somebody like him squander another opportunity.\n\nHe\u2019s also likely on a two year contract. They say \u201cmulti year\u201d for whatever that\u2019s worth. I think of the end of the day, we were sorta trapped into hiring a coach because time was running out and Steve was familiar with the front office and the franchise. MDA would have made more sense but we also don\u2019t know what kind of control he wanted. With Steve he\u2019s not gonna ask for the key to anything nor does he deserve the right to have them. That\u2019s what I see.\n\nIf he sucks, you can bring on an assistant as a temporary and you can start the coaching search halfway through the year and not be forced into something. I think the team took too long to decide on Kenny and by the time they did, and he flaked out, it just left our backs against the wall.\n\nI think when Kenny turned us down any hire we made MDA included was going to look like a desperate play. I think Steve was a safe bet because it\u2019s a very low risk proposition in all likelihood.\n\nI think you\u2019re not going to get the same Steve that you got before because this is a completely different roster. \n\nThis said I don\u2019t love the hire cause I don\u2019t like rehashing the past. I really wanted to try somebody different but when I look at this from the perspective of the front office and timing and all the other things that come into play, I get it.\n\nEdit: grammar", "I honestly don\u2019t understand why bringing a defensive minded coach to a team with this kind of offensive firepower is a bad thing. We need a good Center, yes. But this team struggled greatly on the defensive side of the ball. This could be a fantastic decision if you think about it.", "New starting lineup:\n\nKemba\n\nMCW\n\nBatum\n\nMKG\n\nDwight Howard", "The important thing to take from this is that Gordon will return from last season's fall with the Balrog to become more powerful than ever.", "It honestly isn\u2019t a TERRIBLE hire.

This is a real head scratcher.", "The Eye of Cheese Eyes", "terrible juju", "Now that I\u2019ve cooled down a bit I\u2019m not too terribly upset with this hire considering what Cliff could do with some absolutely atrocious rosters. I\u2019d argue this roster may be even better than that 2016 one that was a 6 seed.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think bringing him back was the best choice. We\u2019re a young team, and we literally just drafted a center to fill a gap, one we probably expect to either start or get significant minutes, and Cliff hates that. He plays vets simply because they are vets, and we don\u2019t need that. We need creative, on-the-fly lineups and flexibility in the starting five game to game. That isn\u2019t Cliff. He\u2019d be a great assistant for us IMO, but I\u2019m not happy about him being HC again.\n\nMaybe he\u2019s different after his time with a young Orlando team, I dunno.

We are a young team and unless he\u2019s learned a shit ton of lessons, our young guys aren\u2019t gonna develop at all.\nIt\u2019s most likely a big fuckin regression. I hope we\u2019re all wrong but I\u2019ll be very surprised if that\u2019s so.", "It's a bad move cause out of the millions of basketball minds out there they for some reason decided to go back to a guy they already fired. \n\nThis is like your friend going back to his ex girlfriend after he just got dumped by a side piece. And I'm just sitting here listening to him rationalize it like you poor, poor guy. You're going to get your heart broken again.", "I don't hate it as much as I thought I would, but player development is so essential in the NBA and it's just hard to see the team excelling at that with Clifford around. As a small market team we absolutely need to to develop talent that is young, cheap, and controllable.", "It could go both ways, but the Cliff hate is so exaggerated. He is far from perfect but he's a smart coach who's MO is to make talent overachieve. His main knock was not playing or giving chances to deserving rookies, which not only isn't true, but apparently Borrego did the same thing while accomplishing less with a much better roster. Why aren't we shitting on him for being so useless\n\ntldr: we have plenty offense, no defense. Cliff hopefully ups our defense game", "I agree. It's a one-year try-out in my opinion for Clifford. \n\nThe Hornets aren't going to let LaMelo go, they're going to extend him. \n\nYes, the worst thing that happens is they regress in W/L trying to fit it together, but we don't know what Mark Williams will do for the defense, and certainly the offense in PnR, so worse comes worst comes to worst they have to dump Clifford and build around LaMelo and Bridges, like the plan currently is. \n\nI'm being optimistic that it will be okay, although, I would have kept Borrego one more year since he's helped them progress W/L each year since his hire and seemed to be filling in pieces year to year pretty well.", "Don\u2019t sleep on Roy Hibbert man was a dog on the Pacers", "To be fair, a lot of that hate was due to Jason Kidd being a domestic abuser.", "Agreed but Mavs fans didn\u2019t have Kidd as a coach just 4 years ago. I\u2019d say a bit different there", "If I recall, most of the criticism was for off-court stuff so I don't think it's exactly comparable", "I'd like to keep an open mind. Care to elaborate?", "I like it a lot better than a lot of the popular alternatives out there", "what a time", "Actually Clifford will give him 40 minutes even if he plays the same for us as he has been for everyone else", "You didn't hear?

He\u2019s paid too much to too many bad players is a different problem.  He\u2019s not cheap though, at least nothing he\u2019s done has shown that.  I know he\u2019s said he\u2019s unwilling to go into the tax unless he has a contending team and I can\u2019t fault him for that.  I wouldn\u2019t either if I were him, but I\u2019d be happy to pay a premium if it meant having a team capable of winning playoff series or more.", "By old school you mean? When players were tough? Resilient? Knew how to play hard? Play defense? I think that\u2019s exactly what the 2021 Hornets were lacking. That and a center who can at least average a double double.", "Yea but for that situation to be accurate, your friend would have been a good guy but dated the girl when she was still figuring her crap out. Then he went back to her when she\u2019s in a much better place.", "Those are my thoughts as well.\nTo the JB crowd: WHERE WAS KAI JONES?", "Most of it was his perceived detrimental influence on Giannis\u2019 development and being a bad asshole coach.", "It\u2019s a bit different too considering we don\u2019t have a single player on the roster from when he was coaching last and different groups have different needs, but having had a coach previously doesn\u2019t meant the situation is 1 to 1, nor am I saying it was the best higher just a tad more nuance to it", "The short answer - he\u2019s a good coach who excels at communication and will hold our players accountable without leaving them in the dark. \n\nLong answer - he\u2019s a former teacher turned basketball lifer who decided to marry the game instead of having a family. When Lamelo wants to be in the gym at 2 am, Cliff won\u2019t make sure the gym is open he will be there with Lamelo working to get better. All the criticism of him not playing young dudes is misplaced. He plays young guys if their head is right. Kemba, Cody, mkg all saw big minutes under him. He just doesn\u2019t put up with monks bullshit so this sub doesn\u2019t like him, bouknight and Kai seems to have dedicated themselves to getting better Cliff will love that. Most of his former players love him, kemba walker swears by him. He\u2019s coached some teams with some shit guards. We had a fun offense the year we had Lin. I think the fact that every lineup we put on the court will have 3 to 4 guys who can create their own shot will be a huge plus for him.\n\nI think we will remake the roster a little bit. I could see oubre and terry on the way out. With a veteran center and 3-d guard coming back. Is that Turner and brogdon? Is it Richaun Holmes? No clue.", "If nothing else I could start [Star-Wars-Memeing](https://i.imgur.com/j2RJ7V7.jpg) again.", "[never forget lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/83d9ll/michael_carterwilliams_201718_season_tribute/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)", "Any news on Batum or Kidd-Gilchrist?", "Bring back?  The question is what will we give up in the MCW trade?", "Some of those teams were certainly disappointing, but the two playoff teams were actually solid. 12-13 was decent, not gonna do much but just making the playoffs and winning games legitimized the Bobcats and Charlotte basketball. We were an absolute joke before that. The second playoff team, 15-16, was actually damn good and competitive. We were a hair away from closing out the series at home in Game 6 until D Wade went nuclear right at the end (thanks Purple Shirt Guy). The years after 15-16 were all not great, for a lot of reasons including the implosion of Nic Batum. \n\nI\u2019m not a fan of Cliff hire now to be clear. But he deserves a lot of credit for taking a joke of a franchise and actually making them somewhat competitive.", "That\u2019s somewhat on him.  Everyone in the NFL but us knew Darold is ass.", "Problem with Kenny was paying his assistants", "I don\u2019t think MJ is cheap so much as he just doesn\u2019t want to gamble with his money. I personally don\u2019t like the passivity but I get it.\n\nLike, if we were a 60 win team and we were in the ECF last year with a real chance to win it all, yea, he\u2019ll go into the tax for that as a championship team is a profitable team. But to go into the tax for a team that may or may not be able to do better than 41-41? Yea, I get it.\n\nThe only \u201ccheap\u201d thing he\u2019s done, imo, is refuse to pay for the new assistants to bring Atkinson in. Not wanting to go into the tax for Miles is kinda stingy sure, but it\u2019s understandable, as just re-signing him doesn\u2019t guarantee a deep playoff run. Now, going into the tax in a few years if we develop like we should I can see Mike doing. I don\u2019t expect LaMelo to be allowed to walk for example.", "[deleted]", "You have a point, I like Mark Williams a lot", "I also am not a fan of this hire but I also agree. Miles, LaMelo, Hayward\u2026 these guys are already quality players. Good players. With the exception of Hayward, I do t really see any of those guys going all Batum on us because of their ceilings and age.\n\nCliff won\u2019t make these guys worse.

If I\u2019d have to make a guess, his contract expires conveniently right when all of JB\u2019s assistants contracts expire.

All of those awful contracts for like 15 seasons. He hasn\u2019t had good luck and he hasn\u2019t made great decisions on coaches and players but he hasn\u2019t really been what I\u2019d consider cheap as an NBA owner.  And he seems like he\u2019s getting better and the turning point was accepting the rebuild after Kemba\u2019s contract ran out and focusing on player development.  Drafting better and getting lucky (finally) with LaMelo has positioned us better than we have ever been since the Bobcats were born.", "I see that happen quite often when a coach is in win-to-keep my job mode", "Not really. Cliffords first run here was with complete garbage for a squad. He still made the playoffs.", "If I told you we hired a coach who was defensive wizard who took 2 very flawed rosters to the playoffs multiple times people would be thrilled. We hired the guy who turned kemba from decent guard to all-star guard. On the surface it\u2019s super easy to criticize and Cliff has his faults. He\u2019s stubborn as hell. And I don\u2019t think his offensive system is perfect but I\u2019m of the opinion that if Lamelo is running an offense it will be a top 10 offense. He just oozes that much drip. The offense will be free flowing and people will get the ball in a great spot bc we have an awesome point guard.", "Agreed. Bringing Mitch in I think has been the big thing. He\u2019s one of \u201chis guys\u201d as a UNC guy sure, but previously Jordan surrounded himself with yes-men that had no spine, which was part of the problem. Mitch I\u2019m sure has told Jordan at some point \u201cMike, that\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d and saved us from a bad signing/draft pick.\n\nI\u2019ll admit I was skeptical of Kupchak at the beginning, largely because of his bad stint in his last few years with the Lakers, but he\u2019s been borderline Nostradamus for us here. I never expected the Rozier S&T to be so lopsidedly in our favor, for example, but holy cow.", "I love the confidence! And I really hope you're correct. But you've definitely helped me look at this through a more positive lens that's for sure and I appreciate that", "No GM will hit on all decisions.  His worst ones are giving Terry a big deal and this recent draft (basically burning a late lottery pick). I\u2019m also worried he would\u2019ve drafted Wiseman if he could\u2019ve.  But in the big picture, he\u2019s been very good especially with what\u2019s become of our second round picks.", "Not sure if I agree with you on Rozier. The Terry deal was stellar. That was the going rate for him at the time, it was only a three year deal, and it was an S&T for Walker.

I wish him and his family the best in the future. These decisions are always difficult. Having said that, we have a talented, young core of players which has me very excited about the future of the Hornets. We will begin the search for our new head coach immediately.\u201d \n> \n> Borrego was named the 11th head coach in Hornets franchise history on May 10, 2018. In four seasons with Charlotte, Borrego posted a 138-163 (.458) record.", "I didn't hate Borrego but it's definitely not a good look as a coach when you follow up a terrible loss in your biggest game of the season with an even worse loss the following season", "If we lost in OT to the Hawks I think he'd still be HC.", "It's the right move. Yes he's proven that he can develop players, but his rotations and in-game coaching are atrocious. Weird lineups, benching guys when they're hot, players get buried in the bench for months only to emerge as valuable contributors, terrible defensive scheme that gives up a lot of threes. Those issues have been there since day one and not gotten better, I'm not sure what changes this offseason to suddenly alleviate them. Raptors fired Dwyane Casey to take that next step, we need to go find our Nick Nurse.", "DAMN man. If this is what LaMelo and/or Miles wanted, then I think that's fine. But if the front office just decided they wanted someone else, I'd be very interested to see who they have in mind, because replacing a coach is a pretty big dice roll", "Honestly this is the right call.\n\nI like Borrego, but he's just not the long-term coach for this team. I'm not sure who's out there, but he's just not tactically minded enough right now for the NBA.", "cant say its not deserved, another 10th place and got blown out by even more in the game that really counted. hopefully they'll pay the next coaching group enough", "Was starting to see Steve Clifford tendencies in JB (not giving rookies any run, short rotations for no goddamn reason in the regular season, lack of adaptability, getting murdered by the other team from 3point land, having role players go nuclear against us, etc.), but he\u2019s been a pretty solid coach for us overall.\n\nI just hope we nail the coaching search.\n\nMy personal top 3 wishlist:\n\n-\tJarron Collins: 43 years old, 10 years as an NBA player, 7 years as Golden State Warriors assistant coach, 1 year as New Orleans Pelicans assistant coach. Left the Warriors and reportedly hungry for a HC gig. Draymond Green described Collins defensive game plan as [expletive] phenomenal. Most people have never heard of him, but I think he\u2019d be a great fit.\n\n-\tFrank Vogel: 48 years old, former head coach of the LA Lakers, Orlando Magic, and Indiana Pacers. Championship pedigree, not that old, known for defense up until he got an old ass Lakers squad. Pretty sure he wasn\u2019t the problem in LA.\n\n-\tCharles Lee: 37 years old, played ball in Europe mostly, 2 years assistant coach Bucknell, 4 years assistant coach Atlanta Hawks, 4 years assistant coach Milwaukee Bucks. He\u2019s been an assistant to Mike Budenholzer the whole time he\u2019s been in the NBA, and Bud\u2019s teams have produced pretty solid results.\n\nI just hope we don\u2019t do anything stupid with the front office like fire Mitch as GM and put Buzz in or anything like that. I wouldn\u2019t mind a new GM necessarily (Mitch has been good, especially in the draft, but made plenty of head scratching decisions as well especially in free agency), as long as it\u2019s not just a yes man to Jordan.", "I think this is probably the right move. JB was obviously well liked and a great developmental coach, but the guy wasn\u2019t there with the Xs and Os. He did his job and our guys massively improved. Now we get someone who will force us to play D and keep the O tempo high", "I've not been a big fire Borrego guy. But the last two seasons ending as badly as they have is enough to cost him his job. I think it's the right move.", "I would\u2019ve thought he\u2019d be given one more year. Although I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of Borrego, he undoubtedly was a great coach for them who was running the course. In the process, he brought the best out of all his players. Surely his coaching and rotations were questionable, but I think he did great with what he had while steadily improving year after year", "The wrong coach in Charlotte has been fired", "Great guy for the human side, unfortunately wasn't going to be *the guy*.\n\nThanks for everything, JB.", "Coach K\u2026COME ON DOWN!!!!\nJust kidding that would be terrible.", "Getting your butt kicked twice in play-in games because you didn\u2019t have your players prepared, didn\u2019t do him any favors. The other big factor is LaMelo Ball. He is a once in a lifetime franchise talent that the team is going to lose if they don\u2019t play this right. We\u2019re definitely at that point where we need to go to the next level.\n\nCharlotte has to prove to Ball that they can build a winning franchise around him and also help take him and the rest of these young players talents to another level. I think James groom them to a certain point but we\u2019re sort of at this point where the talent limit is starting to plateau.", "[deleted]", "Wow! Well this will be interesting..\n\nNow that we know he's out for good, what's your gut feeling on a replacement?", "Holy shit this was unexpected. \n\nWE ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A SPICY OFFSEASON.\n\nI'll take 1 Frank Vogel please. Championship coach, defensive savant. Huge praise from Lebron. And Lamelo will always be able to run an offense no issues.", "Wow, 10+ win improvement for 2 years running, only 2 other teams can say that. But Taylor Jenkins, Udoka, and Chris Finch coaching young teams to the playoffs in their first year probably doomed him. \n\nI am 50/50 on the move after two years where Lamelo and the defense didn't improve. Still, the guy has shown he can put together a Top 10 offense...I feel like hiring a defensive coordinator like Vogel might've been the better play here for a team that is basically going to be rolling the dice on their next coach. \n\nOptimist: Hey, at least we are fine with paying two (three?) coaches. Looks like MJ is ready to spend like a real owner! \n\nPessimist: JB MacGyvered a Top 10 offense out of a ball of twine, some chewing gum, and a Lamelo. We should've kept him.\n\nRealist: We don't want to be hiring coaches every two years, it hurts development and makes stars like Lamelo resentful. We need to nail this next hire.", "Could be 100% off base, but I get the feeling that if LaMelo wanted JB to stay then this wouldn\u2019t be happening right now", "Pretty surprising to me honestly. My opinion is the shortcomings come from a flawed roster more than flawed coaching", "Was not a fan of his rotations, or the lack of rookie playing time. \n\nHope they've got someone better in mind, because this seems premature.\n\nIs Kenny Atkinson available?", "Lakers fan here. \n\nFired coach swap?", "THANKS FOR GIVING US THE HIGHEST ORTG IN FRANCHISE HISTORY", "I really thought he had one more year before we made the switch. I'm interested in the reasoning.\n\nWe have to be going after Vogel, right?", "If the front office had bothered to plug the gaping maw in the middle and we had the same year, then I get this.  Otherwise I think he deserved a season with a competent center.  As someone else said earlier, this decision now smacks of mediocre franchise management.", "Hornets greatly overachieved during his years when you consider he hasn't had a single competent center.", "Jay Wright to Charlotte? /s", "This is actually crazy to me.  And a really bad decision I think.  \n\nMan, I dont know.  This could be really good or bad.", "Damn I was hoping he get at least one more year. My hope is the front office acquires a good quality center. If we get the same result next year with a good center, yeah fire him. But the FO never gave him a chance with a good center on this team.", "I am really afraid of who we are gonna hire", "i am in shock. audible gasp. \n\ni have always been a jb defender, but will admit that after the second play-in blow out in a row i was getting skeptical. i was thinking at least one more year with jb. \n\nanyways frankie v time??", "Wow! That's a shock, but I'm all for it.", "That was dumb.", "I don\u2019t know how to feel about this. Borrego seemed to be a player\u2019s coach with good development. I loved hearing about his off court relationship with Melo. On the other hand his rotations and game management left a lot to be desired. Hoping for the best, we really need to hit on this hire if we plan on convincing Melo to stick around after his rookie contract is up.", "I really hate what this feels like. Feels like Mitch is gone and we want to hire a gm and coach the same cycle. Please god don\u2019t hire Buzz.", "It had to be done", "Like the guy, but frustrated the shit out of me at times. Hope we get someone good", "We need a coach who will be able to maximize this cores talents and help them improve where they\u2019re lacking.  Idk who that is, but I would really like someone who has won in the playoffs as a head coach before.", "WOAH!\n\nEDIT: VERY curious who they have in mind to replace him with.", "Enter: Jay Wright", "Y\u2019all got your wish. Be careful what you wish for. This team 100% HAS to make the playoffs next year now though imo.", "Bouknight is free at last", "I feel like he deserved 1 more year, but consecutive play-in blowouts is bad business.", "LaMelo stans crying tears of joy right now. They're setting things up for the Russ trade, right LaMelo stans? \ud83d\ude02", "I think this is a terrible decision. We won 10 more games than we did last year. Say what you want about Kai and Bouk but Borrego has developed talent like no coach in Hornets history.", "Really thought it would\u2019ve happened way sooner than now (if it was gonna happen). Wonder why they waited", "Surprising, I feel like this is not a great idea but we'll see who they hire.", "Two picks and a new coach is exciting! Scary but exciting", "Quin snyder pls \ud83d\ude4f", "I wasn't his biggest fan but I thought he did enough to have another year. Loved what he did in regards to player development but man his in game management was atrocious at times. Also seeing rookies get next to zero playing time got pretty frustrating.   \nCurious to see who they bring in next.", "Sorry to see him go as I felt like we were a couple easy breaks away from multiple 40-50 win seasons (for example we had a stretch this year where multiple key players were out, the difference between 10th seed and 5th seed was like 5 games)\n\nBut I think it is important that we look to take the next step and not stay stagnant, so I hope our next hire is a good one, and is also one that can incorporate our young talents better.", "Snyder or Vogel?", "Sucks cause JB cared so much about our young guys and there was a bound between everyone. But it felt even if he stayed, it would be a prove it or leave it year. It will be a decent decision depending on the hire.", "Wow did not see this coming", "Lakers fan here\u2026I think Vogel would do quite well in Charlotte.", "I hope y\u2019all hire our assistant coach Darvin Ham. Has coached for 2 championship teams now and I think he\u2019d be a really good coach for your young team.", "I dislike this.", "LOL out of nowhere. Makes sense after the play in and countless other instances this season.", "Good, 2 years of blowouts in play ins was enough.", "The guy couldn't ever put together an nba level rotation and led us two national embarrassments. He had to go", "There\u2019s gotta be more. This was premature.", "Tf? If we end up w frank fucking Vogel im barely watching next year", "Wtf???", "The fucked up thing about this season is all their OT games someone (usually Mason) missed a lot of FTs\u2026\u2026.. if he made his FTs more towards the beginning of the season they\u2019d be a 2-4 seed\u2026\u2026. Just saying", "Completely the right move.  No doubt a talent evaluator and player developer, it's time for the X and O guy and general on the sidelines to get us further ahead.", "This seems like a really bad idea considering we\u2019ve been trending up", "I never saw Borrego as the next level coach. His development though has been big especially for someone like Miles Bridges. \n\nIf Charlotte wants a playoff run, they need a playoff-ready coach. MDA, Vogel, Stotts", "HORNETS FANS HOW WE FEELING?", "This is some fucking bullshit.", "Great developmental guy. Bad in game head coach.\n\nSee ya Jimmy.", "How tf do people think the guy that couldn't get fucking LeBron, AD, and Westbrook to the damn play-in is gonna make Charlotte a contender. Please god don't let us get stuck with vogel", "What a horrible decision.", "Wow, didn\u2019t think this would happen tbh", "I think this team actually overachieved for having a winning record, I look at the playoff teams and none are going to lose to us. At best it didn't affect the team at all since the roster is just not that good, at worst it makes Ball and Bridges realize \"NBA is just business\".", "I want Vogel and do whatever we can to get gobert. That's two people who would hold our guys accountable on defense. We would be a top 5 seed for sure", "I never was a huge fan anyways so here\u2019s to hoping we can find an upgrade", "WTF NO", "Vogel pls", "Fuck that what a stupid fucking move", "Well the offseason just got a hell of lot interesting. So what retread is being brought in to \u2018right\u2019 this ship?", "My take is he was a great play caller but his player development and in game adjustments were lacking\n\nHopefully our next coach can fully realize our players potential", "I want them to bring back Clifford if only to make this sub completely melt down.", "How do you guys feel about Mark Jackson", "As a Bucks fan, please go for a development coach like Kenny Atkinson", "Wowwwwww", "HOLY", "did the Joker usurp power in the Hornets and Panthers organizations?", "This is surprising to say the least... they better have something big up their sleeves", "I WAS HERE", "wow... mixed feelings... this could be good... or really... really...bad...", "WOAH this was unexpected.", "I don\u2019t know who they have their eyes on as replacement but I agree with this move. He\u2019s an average-ish coach but I\u2019m not a fan.", "Nah this crazy who won't be under contract? Will Kenny Atkinson be free? I don't know if this a good thing or not yet", "Does Melo get to have a say?  I think so. I would love a Willie Green type hire that understands the young players and has the chops.", "I appreciate that they didn't fire him immediately after the loss to the Hawks. Hopefully, it means that it was a carefully considered decision rather than a snap decision made out of frustration.", "Promotion otw for triano? Or are we about to get frank vogel?", "I want Kenny Atkinson", "Frank Vogel? Play some defense finally? Really depends on the replacement if this is a bad move or not", "Wow.", "we won.", "I hope we will at least interview Atkinson.\n\nBut so far i think our offseason is starting well.", "I think this is the right move. He's not the guy we want to try and push in the playoffs with regardless of our team improvements. A lot of our good wins this year basically boiled down to us shooting on fire and the other team not being on fire imo. When you look at how we perform in the clutch, big games, and especially ot you see how we just don't have anything concrete. Also the weirdness about playing the young players is also concerning to me regardless of us developing decently.", "This reeks of Michael fucking shit up again. He\u2019s under contract for two more seasons and the trajectory is still up. Improving every year and Kup still hasn\u2019t even addressed the defensive holes on the roster. Offense is humming. This makes little sense and given the starting point and roster\u2026considering how cheap of a franchise we are, I think this has the potential to work out very poorly.", "It makes me sad but I'm not surprised.  I just hope that we can actually attract in an improvement because you can definitely do far worse than Borrego.", "Who is up next?", "I\u2019m ok w/it.Moving on\u2026.", "This subreddit is funny. At the midway point I see folks calling for JB's job, and now that he's gone I see folks saying he shouldn't have been sacked.", "Royally sucks for JB. End of the day he did a good job. It just comes down to getting a new voice with different ideas in the building to continue the growth of a young roster. JB deserves a ton of credit for player development, but I do think to keep pushing this forward it was a necessary move.", "Chances on us landing coach K?", "True but my opinion is that regular season\u2019s are too long to put all of the stock into one play-in game.", "If you look back at his entire tenure here, he had 3 high stakes games where the roster was just as good if not better than the other team in that high stakes game.  Orlando at home in Kembas last season (embarrassed) and then the two play ins. It wasn\u2019t a fluke, it was a pattern. Have to be able to win in the playoffs and high stakes games, blame it on the players all you want but those are three different teams across two eras. Not just 0/3 but 000000000/3 each time. I\u2019m glad they moved on, find someone who knows how to win playoff basketball.", "I agree.  Losing like we did in back to back seasons in the exact same fashion isn\u2019t a fluke.  That\u2019s the coach not having his team ready for a high stakes game, one year after not having his team ready for a high stakes game.  It\u2019s a coach who just could not find a way to get his team to play defense and it\u2019s a coach who cannot implement a game sense to stop runs or keep momentum.  Lastly, our end of quarter execution on both ends was atrocious and absolutely cost us multiple games.  It\u2019s like an extra possession and sometimes can be as big as a 6-8 point swing depending on how that last minute goes.  Good coaches maximize those chances and bad ones let the other team maximize them instead.", "If we had won just 1 OT game this year, it would have meant a lot.", ">Raptors fired Dwyane Casey to take that next step, we need to go find our Nick Nurse.\n\nLmao dude this group hasn't even gotten their Dwyane Casey yet, he had the Raptors as a perennial ECF team and we can't even ~~win a play-in game~~ lose a play-in game by less than 20.", "definitely agree with all of this.  especially burying guys on the bench to emerge as contributorrs later and benching guys who are hot.  big red flags", "Not to mention his adaptability is piss poor. When Gordon went down last two seasons we looked awful for a few weeks. Also in game adaptability is awful, most games this season when we started losing it was nearly impossible to get back the lead unless we were white hot or the other team just collapses (Ish Denver Game)", "Can Nick Nurse be our Nick Nurse?", "Its hard to really blame him for his lineups when he was never given the personnel to matchup with teams with a dominant big man. Not saying he couldnt have been better, but if anything, the team has overperformed given the pieces he had to work with (no defensive starters and some of the worst centers in the league).", "For real.. JB was part of the making the team a family culture. He'd had Lamelo and co around for dinners regularly, especially in off season.\nJB wasn't the greatest coach, but you do have to question the decision to end that bond/chemistry with the future stars.", "It's gotta be Vogel right? Regardless of what happened in LA he's still a good coach and probably the best coach available at the moment", "D'antoni....for melo", "I'm terrified Mitch is out too and MJ is gonna hire his friends to run the organization", "I agree, dudes a great guy and a good players coach, but he has shown time and time again that he can\u2019t get players fired up for the biggest games. Heck he couldn\u2019t get them fired up for the 1st quarter in most games", "They improved by 10 wins... not his fault the east got so much better.", "I think Frank Vogel would help in our defense greatly, however his offense leave much to be desired. His strategy in the bubble is \"give ball to AD and LeBron\". Rondo and LeBron really helped him win that championship for the offense they made.  \n  \nIf we choose him, I hope we found another assistant coach for offense.", "I don't agree but this is a solid take.", "I wonder if he could have a second career being part of a program focused solely on player development. Idk if that\u2019s in the G-League or scouting or what, but nobody can deny hit ability to develop players to take that next step.", "who did he make better that wasn't naturally going to get better?  hard disagree on this.", "Which one then?", "We would get memed", "1000% agree. I wanted at least one more year of Borrego on the condition that we get a good center this off-season. Let him work with that and if we get the same result, THEN fire him", "The FO did address the C position.  They gave him rookie options to develop, and he repeatedly refused to use them or used the absolute worst one (Nick Richards).\n\nIf Borrego had tried those guys and they had failed, then sure, blame it on the FO, but Borrego never even tried the options the FO did give him.", "Vogel is a way better coach than Borrego. It\u2019s not even close. Vogel has been to numerous conference finals, endless playoff games, a championship. He\u2019s underrated.", "Time to go hunting for the next Udoka/Finch/Jenkins/Nurse...", "Vogel would be great.", "[deleted]", "Fully agree on the realist take. Firing JB isn't a bad choice if and only if we get a better coach to replace him. Making this gamble while we are in the process of developing a potential superstar and attempting to re-sign one of the best players on the team is going to decide a lot about the next few years.", "I disagree with a lot of these points. First of all LaMelo did get better, becoming a high volume 40% 3pt shooter is a big deal. He needs a coach that emphasizes going up strong around the rim and drawing fouls instead of putting up circus shots. \n\nSecondly, Hornets are a top 10 offense because of LaMelo's unselfishness and pushing the ball in transition, not because of good offensive scheming. That's obvious in the playoffs when they're bad in the half court.\n\nFiring Borrego is a great move, there's no point in keeping around a mediocre coach unless you have a ton of superstars and don't want to risk a bad hire.", "Great take.", "20 year old kid isn't making the coaching decisions yet.", "Kenny\u2019s the same kind of coach as JB. He\u2019ll develop the hell out of a scrappy, young team but he\u2019s not what we should be looking for.", "Pls", "Ngl I kinda like that for both teams", "Yeah, I do have to admit that after years of watching dismal offenses, it was at least a little fun that we had a fast paced and actually effective offense.\n\nOverall I'm ready to get back to a strong defensive and rebounding team. Hopefully we won't have to sacrifice too much offense to get there, but we will see.", "Lol we have had the cheapest coaches the last 10 years in the entire league. No we aren\u2019t paying for Vogel", ">Man, I dont know. This could be really good or bad\n\nAgreed he definitely had his faults but he wasn't an atrocious coach \n\nIt all depends on who ends up being the head coach", "If its from the players, I get it. If this is from the front office, its insanity", "Yeah same. Maybe they see the opportunity for Vogel and wanna jump at it? I know he's defensive minded but I know the Lakers roster wasn't built for defense at all. Can the hornets level up on defense with Vogel?", "Whoever will take the 2m/year contract Mike offers, whatever desperate guy is out there.", "Now we're dreaming, one of the finest basketball minds in the entire world coming to coach the Hornets. I wouldn't believe it until I actually saw him on the sideline in a real NBA game.", "We 100% had to make the playoffs next year regardless and that\u2019s the expectation clearly.  The question was, would we get embarrassed there or not.", "There were also 10 less games total last year.", "Snyder for me", "I like Snyder but only if we get a really good defensive center, other than that idk if his defensive scheme is good, vogel can unlock this team\u2019s defense", "If a GM is ever making coaching or player decisions based on participation trophy games they should be fired themselves lmao", "This. His defensive schemes will only work if he has a defensive-minded roster. And imagine LaMelo and Bridges playing to a strict, slow paced offense. Yikes", "you don\u2019t want to watch this team with a defensive HC?", "Frank Vogel is a better coach than Borrego lol", "Explain please? I would be very happy with Vogel. And it seems like many others would too. I watched a lot of lakers games these past few seasons and if he's given full autonomy like a normal coach, it will probably work out well.", "Vogel is best case scenario though lol", "Trending up from 10th seed and no hope of play offs all the way to 10th seed and no hope for play offs 4 years later.\n\nRegular season record is nothing more than a participation trophy if your team is entirely incapable of playing in a post season atmosphere, still, after 4 years", "Uneasy", "Lakers fan here\n\nVogel is a great defensive coach. With the right role players, he can lead any team to a #1 defense. We didn't have those players this year. \n\nHe's also a terrible offensive coach. Take what you will from that.", "Vogel is way better than Borrego lol. He\u2019s been to numerous conference finals and has a ring. He\u2019s not to blame in LA and everybody knows that.", "The Lakers is old and injury prone... Just having big names don't mean jack if they can't coexist, not to mention salary, I'd also like to add they had no good defenders outside of like 3 players for a defensive coach", "No to Gobert yes to vogel", "Who the tf are you", "No thank you. His time with the Warriors was really tumultuous behind the scenes. He seems like a genuinely awful person to work with.", "Is he still under contract with the warriors?", "The post season is the only games that matter, regular season is practice for that big moment where JB leaves a steamy pile of shit on the court", "Man though we are the ONLY play in team that looked awful. The Pelicans weren\u2019t that much better my man", "Yeah Casey was coach of the year and the Raptors were the #1 seed his last season.  He just lost to Lebron every year in the playoffs and that got old for them.  The Hornets haven't been to the playoffs since 2016 and have not been out of the first round ever.  (Well at least as this version of the hornets.)", "It took him 2 whole years to teach Cody Martin to take one less step as a digger.  2 whole years!  That should've been handled in 5 minutes in practice the day after the first time he screwed it up..", "I don\u2019t get the noise around Nurse being out in Toronto, where did that come from?", "Agreed. I have a feeling this is going to be less of a Dwane Casey firing and more of a Dave Joerger firing. Joerger got the most out of that Kings squad and then the Kings regressed under Walton.  \n  \nBe careful what you wish for, because you just might get it.", "What scares me the most is when JB came in that is when player development became drastically better.", "snyder will most likely be fired after the jazz lose", "Mike Dantoni? or did he retire", "But at the same time we don\u2019t ever pay coaches much, we always pay the least in the league. Why would he want to coach us when he surely has better opportunities?", "Vogel is a good coach but be warned he has weird rotation issues too. We also put a crap roster together so that doesn\u2019t help but the rotations were an issue even in 2020", "Joerger and Dantoni would like a word.", "Vogel or D\u2019Antoni are on my wishlist.", "Mitch is his friend.", "Mitch ain\u2019t going no where I hope", "Yup I think that's the biggest issue here. Every first quarter coming out flat and getting destroyed in every big game.", "I don\u2019t really like this argument. We played 10 less games last year. But I agree the East got better.", "There were 10 games more in this season compared to last due to COVID if I recall correctly so really it's more like 5 wins. \n\nYes the East got competitive, but I think the most telling stat to me besides the horrific play in losses is losing 0-7 in overtime. Sure one or two of those might have been lost because of bad officiating but not winning a single game in overtime is absolutely due to poor coaching ability in my opinion.", "I personally think he ends up in an assistant role for a year or two, and then takes over for Pop after he retires. That would make me so happy. I love JB and wish him nothing but the best", "That would be dope having him as a G- League coach or if he would've stepped down and be an assistant wouldn't have been bad either", "I never said he was the long term coach as I thought he was close to hitting his ceiling. What I thought he was good with was more connecting and developing and making all of his young guys flourish. Many coaches don\u2019t quite give that kind of presence for their players. Prior to Borrego, all our draft picks looked like duds and he managed to take everyone drafted during his tenure and he either helped them hit their ceiling or go above it. I\u2019m also not going to say all our issues would\u2019ve been solved if we had a better center, but I would also be lying if I said having one would have done nothing. X\u2019s and O\u2019s wise, he is less than to be desired, but I think having him was definitely good. In this sense, I think he helped bring the best out of all his players.

This feels like a step back if we're just going to go into another mini-rebuild to fit this new coach's scheme. Especially now that we owe JB a bunch of money because of his extension.

He also has played plenty of young talent every year but this year. There isn't much evidence towards \"he hates young players\". He was given mason plumlee as his starting center and told to win. He won 43 games with mason fucking plumlee starting. On the court, there wasn't much more to be done with this roster.

We don\u2019t see what they do every day. JB likely had little to nothing to do with actual development, that was probably on assistants and personal trainers. We\u2019re also a very young team, and the expectations should be they naturally get better every year till they hit there prime.", "Thor is *probably* a rotational level big. VCJ had one good game, along with a plethora of other examples of him just being bad/lazy/lost. Richardson doesn\u2019t have that one good game, but he was a bit more consistent with his shitty-ness. Kai is just too raw currently. I only saw one G-League game, but I wasn\u2019t super impressed with anything but his physique/athletic ability.\n\nIMO, Cody/Biz/Plumlee/Trez have been our only legitimate options at center throughout JB\u2019s tenure. The problem is they\u2019re all rotational level bigs at best. It\u2019s obviously less than ideal, but our goal has absolutely been to win the last two years, and playing *worse* centers then our already shitty center rotation wasn\u2019t a viable option.", "Perfect? Idk.. His schemes only work if he has the personnel. The only guy right now who can thrive on Vogel\u2019s playbook is Cody Martin. And don\u2019t ya\u2019ll remember how bland his offensive schemes back when he was with the Pacers?", "What about that stretch in late January and February when it\u2019s really time to start playing your best basketball and we lost 11 of 13 games. Was there no big games in that stretch? And let\u2019s not forget Borrego would not start Melo over Devonte Graham until Graham got injured and he had no choice. Who is to say Kai couldn\u2019t have been the answer at the small ball 5 to get plumlee out of there? We will never know because Borrego REFUSED to play him any significant minutes in an 82 game season. Jt thor playing good he just falls completely out of the lineup when mcdaniels comes back. I used to be a Borrego supporter but what he did to kai and bouk adding that up with collapsing two straight years. Getting absolutely embarrassed on national tv it\u2019s inexcusable.", "Yes that's exactly my point. We're NOT setup to win a title immediately so changing coaches from a guy that has improved his win total by 10 wins every season while NEVER having a competent NBA starting C seems asinine when we still need to overhaul our roster for the new coach to have any real success past where Borrego was. If you think we would have been a 6-8 seed with this roster then I'm assuming you're not watching the East because our roster is nowhere near as talented as the 6-8 seeds in the East this year. Our center rotation was Montrez Harrell and Mason Plumlee. That's not playoff caliber.", "Thats the only rationale for this move. JB served his purpose for the last four years, but maybe not the answer for the next four.", "Yeah that makes sense, but I am just so sick of having no interior defense and getting stomped by even mediocre centers", "claude Lemieux, same to you lol", "There's some philosophy to that.  You typically want your 4 best players starting and your 5th best player off the bench as a 6th man.  That way your bench unit isn't straight up much worse than your starters.  And your starters should in theory be good enough to carry that week link.", "True im not defending him. Last year it was Biz over Zeller. Just pointing how bad the personnel on this roster is.", "Yeah lamelo also isn\u2019t a rookie and miles and pj on year 3 helps that", "making someone better and giving them 20 shots a game with a permanent green light are different things.", ">VCJ had one good game, along with a plethora of other examples of him just being bad/lazy/lost\n\nThis literally did not happen.  There was never a point where VCJ was clearly bad/lazy/lost, and if there were we wouldn't be having this conversation.\n\n>IMO, Cody/Biz/Plumlee/Trez have been our only legitimate options at center throughout JB\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe problem is that with the exception of Cody and maybe Harrell, absolutely none of those were legitimate options.  We were reliably getting railed with them on the court, and were fine whenever they weren't.  The entire point is that the options we didn't know about probably weren't actually worse, because it's virtually impossible to be worse than those guys were.", "[removed]", "Trust me I am too but this year draft could most definitely help us fill in the holes that we got\n\nEdit: now if we can get an absolute steal for Rudy I might be for it", ">You typically want your 4 best players starting and your 5th best player off the bench as a 6th man.\n\nThis is both not true and highly dependent on team context.", "Go watch any game outside VCJ\u2019s singular good game against the Nets and you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m saying. That man stood around and watched more than just about anyone I\u2019ve ever seen on an NBA court. I\u2019ve said it a bunch, and I guess I\u2019ll say it one more time, that man needed a nap out on the court.\n\nThat\u2019s just where we\u2019ll have to disagree, though. It could absolutely be worse. It could always be worse. Go watch VCJ or Richardson\u2019s minutes and tell me it wasn\u2019t worse lmao. Cody/Biz/Plumlee/Trez are all more than capable backup/3rd string centers, but extremely problematic if you have to start any of them for extended periods. That\u2019s been our entire problem.\n\nThe problem boils down to roster construction and expectations set by the FO. I personally wouldn\u2019t have put us in a win now situation so soon, and therefore would\u2019ve been more okay with seeing what we had in the young bigs. That\u2019s not the direction the FO went though, so it makes sense they were never given a shot. They were absolutely worse than what we trotted out, as bad as that might sound.", "Sure. You aren't going to find it on every team and in every situation. But look at some starting 5's across the NBA and you'll see it.", "I have watched every Carey game.  That literally did not happen.\n\n>Cody/Biz/Plumlee/Trez are all more than capable backup/3rd string centers\n\nCody and Trez, yes.  Biz and Plumlee are both well below the threshold for a backup on a good team.\n\n>They were absolutely worse than what we trotted out, as bad as that might sound.\n\nThis is what you keep coming back to, but I simply see no evidence that it's the case.  When Thor was on the court, we were better (than we were with Plumlee).  When Carey was on the court, we were better (than we were with Biz).  Richards was worse, but he shouldn't have been getting play either based on the available but limited evidence.  Maybe it doesn't bear out on a larger sample, but you have to at least test that when the options you do have were all sub-replacement.", "Okay, but like let's say that's true -- in all of those cases, the actual starter is at least a guy who should actually be playing non-zero minutes.", "You don't think Plumlee should be playing at all? DNP? \n\nI think he's a 12-15 minute guy unless you have an ATL center rotation or something.", "Correct.  I think Plumlee takes advantage of a hole in modern aggregate stats that makes him looks like a backup when he's actually far worse.", "Just out of curiosity how is this apparent in his play? fyi I think Plumlee is terrible and his advanced stats have always confused me.", "So the way most aggregates in the modern era work is that they take the players box score numbers as a quick and dirty estimation of how good the player is and then bump that number up or down based on what the lineup data says they actually did.\n\nWhich means that if you have a player who plays a style that causes him to record box score records in a way that is \"empty\", like Plumlee does in multiple ways (the assists and rebounds are particularly egregious), the stat has no way to handle that because it's tuned to not overadjust from the lineup information since that works best for the average player.  And on average, those stats are the most correct handling of the inputs available.  But when there's a large divergence between the two (Mason Plumlee's an example in the negative direction, but Malik Monk is one in the positive direction), the stats sort of break. It's an acceptable breakage -- a good explanation of the model should explain that kind of thing -- but it does mean that a face value result there may be misleading."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

We can\u2019t operate the same way the big markets do so what exactly is the problem with this?\n\nAlso.

Unless LaMelo actually hits his full potential and manages to become a top 10 player this team is going to keep being a perennial 7-11 seed that gets thumped in the first round if they even manage to get in.

We probably could've made the bubble if the season wasn't cut short. I don't think we were too far off from being a 8-seed if all 82 games happen. \n\nEspecially now with the play-in structure, I think MJ said \"fuck it, if we're a 9-seed, we'll still have to compete\". \n\nI just didn't see us making true \"tanking\" moves tho. If so, we would've dumped Zeller/Batum/Rozier earlier, but here we are. So I think MJ just wanted to capitalize on it. \n\nI don't necessarily fully agree with it, but maybe this will work out. We still have some team friendly contracts to move at the deadline, so perhaps we can add some solid role guy by then. \n\nIdk. I'm mixed, but I do think his fit will be good here. But damn... That's a ton of money", "Meh, we also have a decent amount of young talent to build with now with Lamelo, PJ, Devonte Monk and Miles.

Hayward can fit and help immediately, he gives Melo and Graham a reliable wing scoring option, and he brings some solid vet experience to a very young roster. \n\nToo bad it's so expensive, but realistically, who else is going to want to come to Charlotte? \n\nEven if we didn't sign him, I think we'd still be fairly competitive for an 8 seed with just our young guys.

Also I doubt we see any run like the start they had last year.

Neither do I, but he\u2019s talking shit.", "I think that\u2019s the correct statement.  \n\nHe\u2019s worth $25 mil a year.  He got $30 mil.  He\u2019s overpaid $5 mil a year.   \n\nThis isn\u2019t as bad as it feels.  He\u2019s a great player with an injury history.", "I think it's a cyclical thing then", "1,000% this.

It's a high risk-high reward move where the rewards may not be immediately apparent.", "Yeah from a production standpoint we\u2019ll just have to see what\u2019s a bigger factor: more scoring opportunities or more focus defensively\n\nBut honestly Graham should be so excited right now.

We can sign them anyway if they end up being worth a damn with bird rights.\n\nWorst case scenario for me, is we finally have a talented wing in practice for the first time since Jamal Mashburn was on the team.

Obviously the guys we're hiring aren't developing our young guys at the rate they need to be developed, or we're drafting losers. Because we've sucked since 2005. So it's either drafting or development. \n\nAnd regardless of what it is, Gordon Hayward is fucking good, and he is going to be the best wing anyone in that room has ever coached or played with. And that counts for a lot in a league where teams with all-star wings make the playoffs. \n\nI'm not saying we'll make the playoffs (I think as it stands now we're fringe) but you don't improve your team by continuing to suck and just hoping your players get better because \"minutes\" Hayward is a winner, who has been on winning teams and has been a massive part of why those teams have been winning games. \n\nIs it an overpay? Fuck yeah it is. Could we have potentially (or more importantly realistically) done anything else with that money? No.", "What are you talking about? I was with you a little until you mentioned Batum. He is way closer to Holiday than Batum. That's a terrible comparison. \n\nYou can argue that Holiday and Jrue are comparable to Hayward. Both with team success and statistics, as well as age. For instance he was a much more efficient scorer than Jrue this past season, even though he had a much lower usg rate. \n\nIt's true that immediately post injury Gordon was timid, and it shows on the statline. But this year he went back to a lot of what he had been pre-injury. The dude can ball.", "Statistics.", "\\>Also overpaying makes more sense on someone who has a higher ceiling relative to their contract.\n\nWho though? Who??? Any name worth mentioning is not someone coming to Charlotte. \n\nAnd they might come eventually you're right. But probably not for 3-4 years. Which is the end of Haywards contract anyway. \n\nWe have to win enough basketball for our organization not to be seen as a joke by almost every FA in the league, and we can only do that by winning.

During the injury seasons (meaning after they returned from injury) both players had reduced capacity as they they had to rehab. That\u2019s why Hayward was a bench player thoughout 2018-2019 and why Dipo almost sat out the bubble.\n\nIf you want to include injury seasons, Dipo is the better player when accounting for averages: https://www.landofbasketball.com/player_comparison/gordon_hayward_vs_victor_oladipo.htm\n\nNot to mention that Dipo is by far the better defender, not simply because he spends more time guarding the ball. He's been the NBA steals leader and All NBA Defensive First when healthy. Hayward doesn't come close.\n\nAll that being said, stats aren't everything when evaluating a player.\n\nI'm still happy to have the Hayward-Devonte-LaMelo trio this year.

If you exclude their rookie seasons Hayward's averages are better. \n\nAlso Oladipo's elite D was only considered in one season. Forget just the award for a second, that season is the only year he received votes. And while he played elite on-ball defense that year, he did not show that kind of ability in his previous years with OKC and with ORL. You could argue he didn't perform in OKC because of Russ's desire to take risks so that might have overshadowed any potential good D from Dipo and you could also make the case that he was simply too Green in ORL. It's also a fair argument that we haven't seen it since the 17-18 season because of injury but it doesn't take away from the fact that we've only had one elite defensive year from Oladipo. \n\nSo when we compare the two, yes we have one year where Oladipo greatly outshined Hayward, and you can argue he is a flat out better defender than Hayward, I think it's important to take note of Hayward continually improved D. So much so that he had a comparable rating to everyone on the Celtics and his absence made the Celtics give up roughly 4 more points a night. \n\nI think in terms of our player development, Hayward is the better offensive player because he can create his shot just as Dipo can, but to me, where Gordon outclasses Dipo as much if not moreso than Dipo outclasses Gordon on defense is in his offensive versatility. \n\nTake spot up shooting for instance. Hayward pretty consistently hits roughly 42% of his spot up jump shots while Dipo hits roughly 38. \n\nOur offense is going to require Hayward to make plays without the ball in his hands for our young guys, especially Ball, to develop. And I don't think Dipo does that for us. Although that's not the argument and I realize now that I'm more making an argument about Hayward being a better fit than a better player lol. \n\nBut to get back on track a bit, I really don't see, outside of one elite defensive year on Dipo's end, a clear-cut case of Dipo being better. I definitely think you can argue it though, especially based on Dipo's play in the bubble (and taking a more deep dive into his stats).

He's still a good rim protector and rebounder so it's not like he's washed up completely. He could be a steal if his ego is kept in check. \n\nPlumlee sucks. I'm a Suns fan and I watched him breakout with Phoenix in his first year here but he fell apart after that, when Alex Len finally was available after preseason surgery. So Plumlee had great start to his sophomore season but literally fell apart once he had a very raw rookie start challenging him for playing time. I was glad he was shipped out, he was 3rd on our depth chart at Center and basically a 12th man and he tried demanding a trade. We moved him in a bigger deal and no fan has missed him.

Especially if Kemba leaves and it is out of our hands, it is time to just bite the bullet and rebuild properly.\n\nIt won't be pretty or fun, and we won't have a 60 win season with our best player being Batum or Bridges, but it has to be done, and it is out of our control at this point.", "Right but like we could have had Bradley Beal.

Pull for your team to win the game? Hell no, pull for them to lose so they can maybe draft a player that may be good. Then in three years pull for the team to win for 2-3 years then revert back to pulling for losses. It's legitimately fucking gross.", "I'm saying that even if you tank, there's no guarantee that it'll pay off.  We had the worst record in NBA history in a year where there was a franchise-changing player (Davis), but we still missed out on the number 1 pick. \n\nYou have the best chance at getting an All-NBA player if you have the #1 pick, but even it isn't a sure thing.  In recent history (2000-2015 drafts), there have been nine all-NBA players selected with the #1 pick, 9/16-- just over 50%. After the #1, the chances drop off a pretty big chunk, but #2 and #3 picks still offer okay odds at getting an all-NBA player. Picks 4-10 are a crapshoot and outside of the lottery picks you're basically hoping for a miracle. \n\nBecause you can't count on every top pick to work out, you really need to have a top pick for a few consecutive years to be assured one of them will pan out. \n\nUnfortunately, the way the NBA draft odds changed for this year, the very worst teams are less assured of getting a top pick than before. So it isn't enough to be one of the worst teams for a few consecutive years, you also have to be lucky in the lottery. \n\nAssuming there's a 50% chance of drafting a All-NBA player with the #1 pick, you need have the #1 pick twice to be assured one of them will pan out. There's only a 14% chance of getting the #1 pick if you're one of the worst three teams in any given year. If my math is correct, you only have a 2% chance of getting the #1 pick 2/2 years as a bottom 3 team. Obviously, the more years you're terrible, the better your odds get.  (There's a much better chance of getting a top 3 pick two out of two bottom 3 years, but that's still only a 16% chance and the odds of getting an All-NBA player drop off a good bit on picks #2 & #3 from #1)\n\nSo, you basically either need luck or persistence. If you downright suck for 5 years straight, you'll have a pretty solid chance at getting an All-NBA player. Assuming you draft at the level of the league average, of course. If my numbers are correct, the Bobcats/Hornets have had 14 lottery picks including five top-five picks from 2004-2018. Of all of those picks, Kemba Walker is the only one that ended up being All-Star, let alone an All-NBA caliber player.  I think there's a chance we may be worse at this than the NBA average (or at least the previous front-offices were, too early to say the same for Mitch just yet).\n\nEven so, getting one of those top players doesn't guarantee you'll actually win. Since the MVP award was started after the '55 season, only eleven #1 picks have won it. An even more depressing stat, since '85, only seven #1 picks have won the NBA title. \n\nLong story short, I'm not sure tanking works unless you're willing to commit to a **LONG** tank and even then you're still rolling the dice. Even if you draft some great players, you need a great coach, cap management, and players from free agency and trades to fill out the roster. That isn't even to take into account how tanking for years can negatively affect a franchise. \n\nI don't think it is worth it.", "Source that he wants a huge figure? He\u2019s a mediocre G that got hot at the right time. Nobody\u2019s giving him more that 4m.", "This mindset is shockingly myopic. What is your end goal for watching the team? Likely for them to make some deep playoff runs. How do we get that to happen? By giving Kemba the supermax and having absolutely fuck all cap space, while Batum magically becomes the player we all want him to be? \n\nWe have seen what this team can be. We saw their playoff runs and 35 win seasons. We saw our big contract players play, and what they had to offer. We need to rebuild properly if we want to ever see that deep playoff run.\n\nDon't act like you aren't aware of it, or cannot imagine 2 years down the line. Will we tank for a year and magically be a 60 win team the next? No, but we sure as hell have a better shot at winning a playoff series than we would now and have had already. \n\nPeople pull for their team to \"lose the game\" so the future can be better, so tomorrow they can win and win games that are meaningful. People want what is best for the team in the long run, the big picture. Not right now at this very second, at the *expense* of the future. \n\nAnd what do you mean what sports \"has become?\" As if nobody wanted to lose a game or two to get LeBron or Ewing. As if the cardinals were not fist pumping when they lost enough games to get Kyler with the first pick. This is nothing new.", "Dude I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve seen the writing on the wall. I would have agreed with you three years ago but the last three seasons have not been fun. Getting thirty wins against the bulls knicks suns and hawks is just no that fun of a season.

I imagine he wants term, which given his track record teams should be skeptical with. I'd do 3 years x $5M aav though for him in a heartbeat", "Why do people never talk about the teams that do this and fail miserably. The point of a tank job is to get an All-Star or All-NBA player, not throwing one away because the supporting cast didn't work out. There is ZERO guarantee that losing gets you an All-NBA player and there is a 100% guarantee that resigning Kemba gives you one. \n\nWhatever, there are teams that have been trying to \"rebuild properly\" for the better part of a decade and still are mediocre garbage. Give me an All-NBA guy over that every day of the week.", "You're legitimately trying to tell me that the answer is to get rid of an All-NBA player in thw hopes that if we're trash enough we'll maybe get...another All-NBA player down the road? You would rather watch a team actively lose than win?", "Gotta get lucky, I guess. \n\nToronto seemed to build their roster without tanking. DeRozen was a lottery pick used to trade for Leonard, but that was more about SA trying to offload Leonard. The rest of Toronto\u2019s players aren\u2019t lottery picks drafted there, either. Lowry, Ibaka, Greene, and Gasol came from trades. Van Vleet was undrafted. Siakam was a late 1st. \n\nGolden State got lucky. They won big with Curry, and won big again with Klay (Curry had injury issues to start his career and took a while to really take off), and really lucked out with Dray. \n\nMiami got lucky with Wade at #5, then lucky again when LeBron and Bosh wanted to join. \n\nSan Antonio got super lucky when they drafted Duncan\u2014they had a good team but Robinson and another of their good players got hurt, causing them to suck and got lucky in the lottery to get their top pick. \n\nOf the teams that have won titles with franchise-changing players they actually drafted in recent memory, the Cavs are the only one that comes to mind. They were bad for several years before they got LeBron. Five lottery picks in the four years before LeBron and none of them made a difference. \n\nEven with LeBron, the Cavs still weren\u2019t able to get over the hump until LeBron left and returned. Between Bron leaving and coming back, the Cavs had five(!) top 5 picks, and only one of them (Kyrie, #1 in 2011) ended up being worth it. It took LeBron plus another #1 pick, and a former All-Star in Love to finally bring a championship to Cleveland. \n\nCleveland is the closest to a success story for tanking, but the odds of getting the #1 picks in both \u201803 and \u201811 were low, so they *definitely* got lucky.  Furthermore, the team never wins without LeBron going back.  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nI think if there is a chance to draft a generational talent like Duncan or LeBron or Anthony Davis (or Zion, is you believe the hype), it is worth taking a chance to tank if your team isn\u2019t going to compete anyways. It is best if you can induce tanking by having one of your best players go out with an injury or have him take a few year vacation in Miami. \n\nWe took one of those chances to get Davis in \u201812, and it didn\u2019t work. The \u201813 and \u201814 draft classes were not worth tanking for, but we were so bad in \u201811 that it took a while to climb out of that hole. I think it can pay to be bad for one season if there\u2019s a player worth the risk, but not to tank long term\u2014the draft is too volatile. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI think the best strategy is to try to win now, but without mortgaging your future with desperate deals. We got too desperate and overpaid mediocre players (Batum, Williams, Stephenson, etc) rather than being disciplined. If you\u2019re gonna miss the playoffs or be a 1st round sweep and there\u2019s a generational lock in the draft, then tanking that year makes sense. \n\nIf not, try to win now and hope you get lucky.", "The goal isn\u2019t to have the most all-NBA players, it\u2019s to win a championship. Does giving Kemba a super max help the team come closer to that goal?", "Did any part of the last three years feel like winning to you?", "It's a hell of a lot closer since there are ZERO champs or serious contenders that have done what y'all are recommended and succeeded.", "Does any part of your approach seem more like winning instead of signing a Top 15 player, waiting for our bad contracts to expire , continuing to draft role players and then using assets to acquire a piece to complement Kemba. They both take 3 years, and mine guarantees a top 15 player. Yours maybe could, or it maybe could end us with the equivalent of Stromile Swift, Steve Francis, and Kwame Brown.", "\"Rebuilding\" would mean we can follow a vision and competently build a full team, which is the antithesis of the current Charlotte Hornets drafting/coaching approach.\n\nAt best all you're doing is taking the current 1-2 year treadmill of 0.500 play and trading it for multiple 4-5 year cycles of trash (~20 wins) basketball, picking up someone decent, then starting another 4-5 year cycle when we fail to build around them or they leave.", "If we have kemba the supermax he would just be the next bad contract we need to wait out.", "Can I see the data on the number of 3x all-star, 3rd team all-NBA pg entering their primes that just fall off the face of the Earth?", "Three time all star in the east twice as an injury replacement.

Reports of offering four firsts for Frank are either wrong or a display of incompetency. He\u2019s scum.

Waist level \"what?\" hands... Not screaming and hard clapping for 5+ seconds. I'm lumping these two players together because apart it's meh but the chronological story makes it seem (almost) intentional seemingly applying rules as they felt. \n\nSpeaking of a given game, Mr Green's antics bit him finally despite another \"letter of the law\" opportunity for the refs to treat a Warrior with the same rulebook they judge Hornets. According to the tech called tonight if you make eye contact with a referee and raise your hands to near waist level that is a technical foul and asking why that's a foul with the same amount of 'disrespect' is of course a 2nd tech and ejection. So when Draymond was complaining to the ref before the jump, then slow reacting to the tip, then complaining immediately again after while looking at a ref and rasing his hands in a \"what?\" gesture before remembering he was playing a basketball game and deciding to play defense... with one tech already this was clearly the time to eject him with 40 some seconds left since, ya know, the whole hands raised slightly in a \"what?\" gesture being super illegal.\n\nMy incoherent ramblings aside there were of course other issues but I'm still very confused about this new rule focus because I'm still seeing a LOT of 100% created by the offensive player contact  being called against the defense. It has bothered me for years and I just figured I had a blind spot in my fandom for this particular rule set. Then they said they were focusing on calling things different to start the season and while they for sure over the last few years begun to or almost completely killed off the flailing threes leading to 3 foul shots and this year they seem to mostly focus on the Harden-like stuff but to my eyes the defensive is still presumed guilty too much. I've never liked the other teams/players doing it and everytime I saw a Hornet example I'd swallow real hard and roll my eyes a bit.\n\nEither way if the Hornets keep winning I'll have lots of time to complain about refs who didn't but very well could have killed our chances of having a chance to win while offering bascially zero solutions.", "FUCK THE WARRIORS AND THE BANDWAGONERS AND THEIR EZ SCHEDULE", "And some of you want to get rid of terry ???", "I love life today.", "We really need better play from out centers.", "That game had it all!", "Gg hornet bros.

We\u2019d instantly be the new \u201cit\u201d team in the league with Melo and Wemby + plus other young pieces...it\u2019d be amazing for ratings.  The league also owes us after AD.

The Bridges situation was devastating and shone a light on how paper thin the rotation was.  The positive thing is that the franchise has been stock piling younger talent.  That's inevitably going to include hits and misses.  Good franchises understand that and keep drafting until they accrue enough hits.\n\nBut the fact is that right now, after the Bridges fiasco, Lamelo is the only young player on the team that looks like a starter on a contender.  Washington looks like a solid rotation player but not necessarily a starter.  Bouknight seems lost although I wouldn't give up on him.  Jones is a wildcard.  McDaniels is worth re-signing.  William's play so far is exciting and he definitely feels like a potential starter on a contender in the future.\n\nIf this team can draft a really high-end prospect near the top of this draft, it radically changes their outlook.  Suddenly, you can squint and see the outline of a perennial playoff team between Lamelo, the new player, Williams, and the young role players on the team like Martin and Mcdaniels.  Bridges becomes a nice trade piece if re-signed.  The team has almost all their draft capital moving forward.  There's clearly a path.  But they need to spend this season playing their prospects and not chasing meaningless wins that will only hurt them in the long-run.", "Now this is how you tank Panthers.", "Wemby tho\ud83e\udd24", "Wemby Wemby Wemby!", "I thought getting the boys back would make us win more but it turns out nobody plays defense and has any intensity", "Great for the tank.

NBA is such a scam, and it\u2019s so obvious. If they just went to the order you finished or only the bottom 5 have a chance, it would help the league. Plus, the closed door lottery BS  has to go. \n\nWhile I\u2019m on this little rant, how about tightening up the salary cap system so teams can\u2019t just have 5 all stars and only pay a penalty fee. I\u2019m sick of these GD super teams. \n\nAnother thing, can we please stop with the bs fouls where a guy gets touched and automatically goes to free throw line, the constant no-call traveling, and all the flopping crap.\n\nLastly, shorten the damn season! Teams don\u2019t need back to back games. You don\u2019t have to shorten it in terms of time, but shorten it by the number of games. It would help with recovery, fewer injuries late in the season, and help with the issue of resting the players everyone wants to see because they wouldn\u2019t need it.

Plus of course they also got the Zion pick, they always get the pick. Plus, they own the Lakers pick, which increases their chances.", "They own the Lakers pick.", "There is a lottery for the pick. So a team can drop or jump in draft position. The NBA decided this system which is similar to the NHL and MLB. In this youtube link was last years draft lottery: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93FWPIyMSUo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93FWPIyMSUo)  \n\n\nAfter the season ends, the 14 teams with the worst record get a percentage chance on being the number one pick. This was the odds last year right after the season ended with a more in depth explanation: [https://www.nba.com/news/nba-draft-lottery-explainer](https://www.nba.com/news/nba-draft-lottery-explainer)  The top 3 worst teams get 14% chance in getting the number 1 pick and so on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then the draft order that actually happened: [https://www.nba.com/news/2022-nba-draft-order](https://www.nba.com/news/2022-nba-draft-order)  \n\n\nBased on the draft lottery odds: OKC, team with the 4th worst record, jump up to the 2nd pick while the Pistons were the unlucky team to drop out of the top 3 to pick 5.

But I get so tired of the style of basketball: pick at the top of the key, drive halfway and pass out for a 3 ball. Constant. It\u2019s boring.\n\nBut to add to that, yes the fouls are just getting out of hand. The stars get all the touch fouls. There is no fear from the offensive standpoint, it\u2019s part of why scoring is so high. Plus, guys are just insanely good. \n\nAnd I swear 90% of the time we are on the losing end of the ref game.", "I think they\u2019re saying that because even outside of Wemby, it\u2019s a good draft class. Obviously we want him but Scoot looks good, the Thompson twins, Cam Whitmore. Whoever we get is going to make us at least a little more interesting to watch", "Yeah, if we secure the worst record at the end, we essentially have an 86% chance of *not* getting the #1 pick.\n\nLucky for us, this is far from a one-player draft like 2012 so if (when) shenanigans ensue, we won't walk away totally empty-handed", "And then call it rigged when we don\u2019t", "We\u2019re the hornets fam we don\u2019t win shit", "It\u2019s looking like it would be a similar to a top 5 pick in the 2003 draft.", "[deleted]", "We need a gif of Cho's face when that happened.

Those killer possesions you see, where the ball whips around 6 times to the open man.. Boston used to do that on the regular and I think that was a LOT easier with Hayward on the floor.  \n\nBut as time went on, you saw longer and longer stretches of early chucked shots and ill-advised iso possessions, culminating in the last quarter of their elimination game where they gave up the series by resorting to an endless sucession of hero ball plays, and I have a hunch that's when Hayward decided he would explore his options.", "Die hard Celtics fan here.

This season his shooting has really turned a corner, getting .418 on 2.2 3PA per game.\n\nDownside: the War on Theis is real. Nobody gets called for fouls as much as he does, and half of them are BS. \n\nIt's going to be really interesting seeing what kind of market he commands next season.

Jaylen doesn\u2019t have that kind of potential IMO. *e: biggest limitation for both is there perceived ceilings*\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t see either of them consistently being top 10 or 15 players in the league at any point in there careers. If you wanna win, you can\u2019t strictly build around that.

I think he'll be an elite scoring talent but thats it.", "I don\u2019t have an exact top 25 written out anywhere but late teens/early twenties maybe?", "Yeah TMac/Pierce (I know lazy C\u2019s comp) are good older guys to compare him to. PG is probably the current guy I see most in him. \n\nI think I got some Celtics fans mad by what I said, but I\u2019m not trying to take shots.

The nicest thing I can say about that is you must have a very unique way of evaluating players.", "When healthy it\u2019s pretty clear to me Hayward is the superior player.

After allstar last year he did go on an absolute tear but his game just doesn't do it for me. \n\nI watched a lot of Celtics last year and the team was always at its best when Hayward had the ball.", "people always love the guys that do flashy moves like crossovers and scores without sharing like ai carmelo and kobe its charming to watch I guess but same here its I always valued team basketball so in my mind gordon hayward better impactwise he do stuff that doesnt show up in stat sheet", "and when gordon have off nights we still have high chance of winning because he can be playmaker in that situation and crate shots for other so we dont rely on to him to score 30 a night", "This is what boston didn't appreciate.

Plus like one was a super complicated x-out that most players would miss because the high shooter was nearly at the top of the key.  \n\nMore importantly, when he was digging adjacent to plays, where in past years he would try to move his whole body into the path, he was staying in position on his man and just getting a swipe in, which was one of his biggest places for improvement.\n\nLike y'all know I'm more than ready to crap on Cody Martin, but legitimately in pre-season and game 1, he's starting to show some actual signs of hope.", "If you're gonna judge someone based on highlights alone you can't make good basketball conversation/takes\n\nWatching the game you'll see he was nowhere near \"weak\" he had some timely buckets, yes he had some negatives (like the attempted charge he took) but more positives", "That game was insane.

Just barely missed that one. No way he should stop", "My point was in that possession he came over in time enough to defend straight up but not to take a charge(not to stop trying to take charge attempts). if you see that play in full speed you can tell that was a blocking foul, he had enough time and guys with him to make the player change up his shot attempt and someone gets the block. Taking a gamble like that late in that kind of game would be fine by him is fine, BUT that one was stupid. Not only was he too late to take a charge, nobody was on the offensive player enough to force him into the charge, We already had crazy energy in the building and you can tell that the charge attempt hurt us. I'd argue if we lost everyone in here would be going against Cody Martin(some still are despite him playing well)", "I disagree. He was only a fraction late. And hindsight is 20/20 as they say. If we lost that game it was gonna be on that ridiculous foul call on miles that gave them the lead with free throws.
