The entire arena chanted his name in unison. Those were the days, I remember coming home from school and watching the boys ball out. Harden, Jeff Green and Russ were always my favorites. Plenty of people criticized Russ(me included) and preferred Durant. But the thing about Russ was that no matter what he would never give up. He played with a drive and passion that was honestly motivating to everyday life and he was loyal to a fault. When Durant left Westbrook could of easily just packed up with him and went to L.A. But instead he gave this franchise a chance, the mother fucker went out there and averaged a triple double. It was so fun to watch all his doubters turn into loyal fans that season. I assume the same thing will happen with Houston after their slander that year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo matter what team Russ is on I will always support him.

It was the first round and we had just won the first playoff game since the move and the whole place was just going crazy. Traffic stopped, people going nuts in the streets, dancing on tables in bars in bricktown. \n\nIt was like watching your favorite band get bigger and bigger and bigger until eventually the weight of it all just collapsed.

His loyalty to his franchise and city is something that is super rare and I know how you guys feel about him, because we feel the same for the Splash Brothers. \n\nSeeing this all play out makes me sad for the day when Steph or Klay inevitably leave us, whether it\u2019s a trade or free agency, or hopefully retirement after spending their whole career with our team. But I know guys like this will always be loved in their cities, and that\u2019s really what matters.

I'm saying that KD is far, far, far from the only superstar to leave a team to join a better team. LeBron was by far the best player on the 2009-2010 Cleveland Cavaliers, but I'm not sure it was one of the worst supporting casts in the NBA. That 2009-2010 Cavs team was the best in the entire NBA by record during the regular season. Were they mostly driven by LeBron? Of *course* they were. But I doubt one of the worst supporting casts could be the best team in the NBA that season by two games. I wouldn't call the Heatles an experiment either. [Let's not forget the hubris they (understandably) had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYe8B--jrbs). Just because Bosh wasn't an all NBA player the previous season doesn't mean he wasn't an elite player in the NBA. From the moment LeBron said he was joining Wade and Bosh to form a team in Miami, it was regarded as a superteam. By comparison, KD joining the Warriors is fairly innocuous. The Heatles were formed because one superstar coaxed two others to join him in Miami. The Warriors' superstar core has been 100% homegrown besides KD.\n\nI'm not arguing that point at all. But forming a super team is forming a super team, however it comes together.\n\nI don't think KD needs to be vilified because this Warriors team is on another level. I'm sure many other elite NBA players would have jumped at the chance to join a team as good as the Warriors pre-KD, if the logistics had all worked out. Here's the paradox: people ultimately point to \"rings\" as the measure of a player. MJ is better than Kobe because of rings. Barkley is knocked down a few pegs because he never won a ring. I'm not going to keep going; its well-known that NBA players legacies are judged by rings. So why should we fault a player for going for rings when that's the culture that we've taught all players to value? Championships matter more than any individual stat - that's the mantra that's been drilled into NBA fans' heads. Why should we expect KD to accept a fate of possibly getting a ring with one other elite player when he has a better chance of getting a ring with more elite players? If you're determined to win money, do you bet on a dark horse or on a favorite?\n\nAs I've said, the two situations aren't the same, and I was never claiming they were. My point is and was that players have been joining better teams going back decades. Hell, players routinely joined elite Lakers teams in order to get rings going back to the early 80's, at least. So KD gets penalized because he's a better player than other \"ringchasers\"? That doesn't make sense to me. Also remember that he was *drafted* by the Sonics/Thunder. He didn't have a choice in the matter, originally. Why do people fault him so much for making a choice the first chance he had one? Is he required to stay with OKC just because they drafted him and he had no say in the matter?", "In the weakest division.

Best place with enough cap without dumping more bad contracts onto us", "There is different rules for different scenarios (IE sign and trade).

Unless the first trade wasn't made official (like paperwork signed and sent to the league office) or was made before the \"start\" of the new season (example being all of the trades that happened during draft night or those trades being involved with the Lakers)\n\n\nI could be wrong but the reason the Lakers number 4 pick during the draft wasn't actually picked by the Lakers but had to go up there wearing a Lakers hat was because those trades weren't official until the start of the season and that's another reason why the Lakers wanted to sign Leanord before the 6th because I believe the 6th is the start of the season and they had all of those trades pending and if he signed after they would have the cap.\n\n\n\nBut I could be wrong.

In as serious a rebuild as the Thunder are going to dive into, they would ideally want higher picks from lottery-bound teams.", "That\u2019s true, but it seems unnecessary to want to handcuff your cap space even during the rebuild. Opening up the space earlier gives you more chances to take on bad contracts to acquire other picks or young talent, or sign speculative contracts on upside plays or whatever, Paul\u2019s money will just sort of be there taking up space. Plus I can\u2019t see him going to the bench with that contract so now he\u2019s eating up minutes you could use on developmental guys.

CP3 would be a great supplemental option for someone with the cap space , but the Heat aren\u2019t in that place . Russ is so good that the Heat would stay in cap hell for him .

But that team is going to have to rebuild too due to age in 6 years and no draft picks.", "Still. We could have had Gordon instead.

He will be paid like one might as well play like one. It's the Melo trade all over again.\n\nPresti is a great scout. That's it. The fact that he failed to capitalize on our homegrown Big 3 speaks volumes. The guy is ass at roster building, dealing with stars, coach selection and timely use of assets.

He doesn't average a double-double even without letting Westbrook have free rebounds and he averages more turnovers than blocks.\n\nThe last couple of minutes were awful for both teams. But I can't help but wonder if the roles would've been reversed and we had the slim lead late if Adams would've be able to grab a couple of rebounds earlier in the quarter when he was the biggest guy on the floor.\n\nI don't mean to suggest that he was the sole reason the team lost. 20 turnovers is on everybody.

And Russ is more likely to stay healthy into the playoffs for the Rockets.  \n\nWin/win. \n\n(And win for me, Rockets are my #2 team because I was a fan of them before the Thunder existed.  Also, remember how cool it was when CP3 played here in the aftermath of Katrina?)", "I live in LA. Literally no one gives a fuck about the clippers. I hate the Celtics, I hated okc, I just didn\u2019t care about the clippers.", "We'll, PG signed on with the idea we had \"unfinished business\", a la the 1st round exit in 2017-18. He thought we'd be better this year, and we won the same amount of games, I think.\n\nMy best guess is he realized he wasn't going to win a ring with this current roster, and that's not what he signed up for. Add in playing with Kawhi and for his hometown, plus a HOF coach and Jerry West, and that might be it.", "I'm guessing he was feeling doubt about his decision to stay last offseason. We're kind of in the same position as last year with hoping Dre returns and plays as well as he was season before last, salary cap restricting our trade options, and a temptation to go home to LA and make a new superteam. I'm guessing he feels like nothing's changed here, while coming off the best season of his career. I highly doubt it had anything to do with Russ(most of his former teamates have nothing but positive stuff to say about him), it's a lot more likely he did it out of fear of wasting his prime.", "Donovan didn't get fired.\n\nWe'd heard from multiple people that have played for the Thunder that he's the problem, and Presti just extended his contract.", "Several things happened. Days ago PG was contacted by Kahwi and asked to force a trade to the clip hence the delay on kahwi a decision. Everyone and their mom knows OKC is literally the highest luxury tax paying team, and have been for three seasons. The owners don\u2019t want to pay that tax, especially with first round exits.. we have been shopping contracts like Adams, Roberson and Dennis because of this. But when PG came to ask for a trade he made it easy for front office. This trade or another was bound to happen, and it was either Russ and pg were untouchable or move one and rebuild while hanging on to the other to keep seats sold.", "One time if they wrong you, yeah sure. \n\nBut going from being \u201cyeah imma stay and win with Russ\u201d to \u201cactually, I wanna play in LA with Kawhi\u201d just shows how tenuous a connection he has with any team. \n\nSo what does it mean to win when you are so transient?\n\n\nUsually I don\u2019t align myself with ownership, but I find it EXTREMELY dishonest when fans pretend that their interests are even close to that of the players. The reality is, as a sports fan of a team, your interests are more represented by ownership than everyone. But NBA fans HATE hearing that.", "Exactly. Players are individual people just like us and they have the right to do what they want. If a job is offering you more money to move somewhere else or putting you in a better position to advance your career accomplishments, anyone will take the offer.", "I agree with you, but the next time this team is in a position to sign a decent FA will be like 2030.", "Not necessarily, look at how the Clippers fucked over Blake what, a year ago? And now look at them.", "Are we watching the same team? The one that I have been watching implodes because of incredibly poor shot decisions. I agree they have terrible shooters, but they also have great defense. I also understand he is huge in the assist department, on the other hand, what do you expect from a point guard? I would say coaching is definitely a factor as well. I admit Russ gives his all, maybe to a fault. He is super sloppy and a really subpar shooter and at times a mediocre finisher. It\u2019s just frustrating to see another star leave and possibly play for multiple titles. I guess it\u2019s good they are at least looking toward the future.", "Downvotes show that people who know more about the subject don\u2019t agree with his opinion. KD said that Russ was the only one who wasn\u2019t the problem( on his burner account), Oladipo never forgets to thank Russ for helping him become the player he is, Russ is the sole reason PG re-signed with OKC, Ibaka still loves RW.", "More like we just got gut punched and don\u2019t feel like taking hits to the balls too.", "Oh I still absolutely hate him. I just put that in there to say we hated him when he made the decision and still do.", "I'm all for defending small markets, but c'mon man Toronto is a huge market. Ontario alone has a population of  like 14 million people. Compare that to like...Milwaukee. Fact is if players need to form a super-team to win they may as well pick the big money cities, i.e. NY and LA, which is what exactly what happened this summer. That's what needs to change, because it doesn't matter if it's Oklahoma or Boston, Charlotte or Toronto, NOT being LA or NY is what kills teams.", "Toronto isn't a small market, FOH", "Did you see how many picks you guys got for him? It's a great trade for the future but yeah I don't see how it fits with Russ's window.", "Because we saw what happened when word got out that he wanted out in Indy. The Pacers got fleeced lmao (obviously the trade looked more even after Dipo\u2019s breakout). Don\u2019t let him become AD, or Kawhi or even Pacers PG. just trade him quick.", "He's a great defender.\n\nWestbrook/Roberson/PG/Grant/Adams is the best defensive team in the NBA imo", "hi, Raps fan here", "we got SGA and danilo too. those arent scrubs. let's see what presti will do next.", "Am I wrong though?  How else can you explain KD and PG bolting the way they did?", "Idk what you were watching but Russ had a couple good games, PG was judt as inconsistent in the playoffs as Russ was so lets not do this right now", "People don\u2019t wanna hear that lol", "I have seen him. He is emotional but thats about it. I guess you are one of those Utah fans shouting slurs and expecting him to stay quiet, right?", "Bron's #1 priority left in the nba is playing with his son.", "i love russ to death but when u have poor shooting and been star from being athletic and fast, that does not translate well to older age.", "I mean I see it hard to win a ring right now, but they've got five first round picks and SGA that they could try and make some additional deals with. Is there a way that you flip these assets and end up with Beal and Love? I don't know, but I'd like to think Russ stays and OKC finds another piece.", "Bruh. He ain't winning a ring with the Thunder...", "Those picks are gonna be extremely late", "We also already have quite a bit of young talent. I think we're expecting some of these guys to make big jumps in the next couple of years.", "Its old", "In my life as a NBA Fan haha", "Maybe in 3 years. But currently Lebron is better.", "Eh, I don\u2019t know about that. Wasn\u2019t Westbrook just hanging out with CP3 and Bron in Bron\u2019s backyard?", "Bruh, Dragic is not the centerpiece of return for this trade, the young assets are. Taking Dragic off their hands just gives us the ability to offer them removing some cap waste, making what we're offering more valuable", "And how well does that stat padding help in the playoffs", "I don\u2019t wanna act like I called it, but damn if I didn\u2019t somewhat see that shit happening.", "Why would Rockets gave up on a superior player?", "Can we all say fuck the Clippers?", "Frankie munoz has been on the clipper train forever", "The hard part is we were rolling until he got hurt.", "You nailed it. It wasn\u2019t a rift with Westbrook, it was just realizing that playing with Kawhi for the Clippers would be a lot better scenario for his career than being smacked by Kawhi-Bron-AD for the rest of his career.", "> The one that I have been watching implodes because of incredibly poor shot decisions. \n\nI agree that Russ makes bad shot decisions.  His long pull up from inside the 3 point line has got to go.  I'd like to see if he would be capable of letting it go on a team of 3 point shooters.  Having one super-star forward whom the other team can blanket on D made these shots almost seem necessary. \n\n> I agree they have terrible shooters, but they also have great defense\n\nAs much as it pains me to say it, I don't think that matters any more in the NBA.  Like Coach Pop said, all that matters now is the 3 pointers.  You can't surround a creator with bruisers in the paint and defenders.  The Thunder not only had that, but they dominated the amount of deflections this year.  That's just not the right goal in this new NBA era. \n\n>I also understand he is huge in the assist department, on the other hand, what do you expect from a point guard? \n\nWell, he lead the league, so he gave me more than any other point guard. I don't know if Russ will ever win a title, but he can certainly be part of a better team than the one he is currently on.", "We used to hate KD back then, we still do, but we used to too", "Spurs have a few chips.  They got a legendary coach and loyalty from players and it's worked out well for them.", "Is Boston considered a small market or being subpar? They have the most titles in the NBA and just signed Kemba Walker to add to a super promising young core.", "Picks from a team that going to be great for years <", "It doesn't and that's the whole reason why it's a terrible trade. Presti needed to grow some balls and fire Billy Donovan to keep George or to be honest if it came down to it trade Westbrook before George", "Do you come in peace?", "Most likely Schroder and Patterson are gone. And hopefully so will Billy.", "KD is a baby-back bitch and seemingly both Russ/PG are upset with the front office (I\u2019d imagine for keeping a brain-dead coach). KD trash talked legit everyone else other than Russ on his burners, yet here you are eating up the narrative that was spewed baselessly. \n\nAnymore dumbass questions?", "[deleted]", "Playing with, playing against, he\u2019d like either one. But like I said, LeBron ain\u2019t spending what could probably be his last season in the league in OKC. \n\nDon\u2019t you understand that if LeBron wants to make it understood that drafting Bronny means getting the both of them that he\u2019ll Archie Manning that thing to make sure Bronny doesn\u2019t land anywhere he\u2019s not in favor of. \n\nAnd, hell, considering the league is discussing the possibility of doing away with the draft, there\u2019s that too.", "He ain\u2019t winning a ring without going the kd way", "If I'm trading WB right now I'm gonna wait it out to get some value. Let him play and manage his load and wait for a disgruntled superstar. OKC is a small market and you guys are gonna feel that pain when he's gone. Cap space isnt as important to you guys as drafting well. Look at what they just traded PG for, A record number of draft picks..", "1) CP3 is more injury prone 2) The best player on the team wants him gone.", "Superior is definitely subjective. \n\nIs Paul the superior point guard? Ofc. Westbrook is a mini wing at heart who the OKC brass has slotted into that 1 guard space over the course of his career. I\u2019ve always thought Westbrook would benefit from having a Chris Paul type in his place at the one with him at the two, with a separate unit for him to run at the one. \n\nWho\u2019s the better baller though? Ofc it\u2019s fucking Westbrook. The guys not small. That\u2019s a 6\u20195\u201d cat who goes steamrolling down the court like he literally wants to Goldberg a bitch at the top of the key. He\u2019s just athletically one of the best his position\u2019s ever seen.", "PG was playing like a top-3 player at that point.\n\nOnce PG plays a dozen or so games outside of a small-market team, the media is going to fully catch on what a player he is, and we'll stop hearing how the Lakers are favorites for the championship.\n\nPG and Kawhi will stretch the floor more than Lebron and AD and will have an elite bench as well.", "I hate how most of it is to stop the Kawhi, LeBron, AD superteam, not explicitly about the George and Russ relationship and how they play together", "I used to do drugs. I still do, but I used to too.", "Having a team player like Tim Duncan to set the culture definitely helped.", "Celtic fan here. Boston isn\u2019t a small market but it\u2019s not a top tier as a free agent destination in the NBA. The Celtics have a storied history but most of the success was a long time ago. They can still attract free agents under the right circumstances, but can\u2019t realistically compete with NY and LA on a regular basis in that respect", "You never know what can happen with injuries. If Kawhi or PG has a serious career altering injury, those picks could pay off. Not saying to plan for or root for an injury but you never know what can happen", "Are we still pretending that we can project five years into the NBA future? 5 years is an eternity.", "Think of all the Cam Paynes we'll get though.", "Nobody is paying even close to this for Russ", "Dont think its worth it to use our 1sts to dump those guys. And why else would teams take them", "You\u2019re a fucking retard if you think KD didn\u2019t leave because of Russ.  And now PG just did the same.", ">And, hell, considering the league is discussing the possibility of doing away with the draft, there\u2019s that too.\n\nGet rid of the draft and they might as well start folding teams.", "Yeah, Russ seems to work great with other stars.", "Unpopular opinion, but AD and Bron's game don't mesh and the Lakers will be middling as fuck.", "Exactly and who knows if that will ever happen again? Honestly the whole league culture was different back then too. A lot more players wanted to stay with their teams. Now they move around every single summer", "Ah I see. Idk I guess I just disagree with the NY attraction. The Knicks anyway. They haven\u2019t been good for 20+ years yet it\u2019s always \u201cwhen the Knicks are good the NBA is good\u201d.", "I agree but in the moment looking at it right now it seems like a gamble that could end up being a joke for the next few drafts. Franchises don\u2019t prosper without taking risks so from a logical stand point I get it. Irrational rn because it\u2019s late and Westbrook is one of my fav players", "Has it been confirmed whether they are actually \u2018Clippers picks\u2019, or are they the result of previous trades?", "Or the fact that no one stays with a team anymore before requesting a trade.", "Ultimately I agree.", "Hawks took the Pacers to 7 and won 60 the next year, we lost in 6 to SA with an MVP KD, Warriors got first rounded to the Clippers, Hornets were still named Bobcats, Grit n Grind was alive and well along with Lob City, Raptors made the playoffs after almost a decade of mediocrity. \n\nDefinitely an eternity ago in this league.", "Most likely not all the picks we got are Clips picks they might have added the heat pick", "Schroder can run a teams offense and Patterson is expiring.", "[deleted]", "You asked a question; I answered it.  \nThanks for your unrelated observation.", "Oh I agree.  Look at what Bron did to Bosh and Kevin Love.  There is no indication that LeBron Blames will adapt his game to make an offence coherent.", "In today\u2019s league there seems to be a premium on players building a \u201cbrand\u201d and marketing themselves. In that sense NY still is a very attractive destination. The fact that the Knicks haven\u2019t been able to take advantage of that is just a remarkable testament to their ineptitude", "Yeah man I'm a Heat fan that likes Westbrook as a player too. I feel bad for the guy, apparently nobody wants to play with him. Hopefully he either goes to a good situation and allows the Thunder to rebuild or he can go back to MVP level in OKC.", "One of them might be a Heat pick from what I read on another thread", "I'm sure more details will come out in the next day or so. The Clippers have/had the 2021 and 2023 Heat first rounders, so maybe those got traded. I'm sure they have other picks too.", "Exhibit a) KD left Exhibition b) PG left\n\nVerdict:  They left because they can\u2019t stand playing with Russ", "That notion is becoming smaller though with the social media and all that. I mean Russ is a huge Jordan star and has a clothing line. \n\nI agree though. The Knicks are so backwards that\u2019s two top 10 players chose the Nets of all places lol", "\u201capparently no one wants to play with him\u201d? KD left to join a 73-9 team (guaranteed chip) and clearly wanted the easy way out \u2014 and PG will play for potentially the new favorites in LA.

Maybe throwing in the towel when it comes to competing for a championship I guess? There\u2019s no route to a championship once PG leaves. Even with PG, we kept losing in the first round. I know injuries played a major role but I don\u2019t blame the FO for thinking that this team (with or without PG) wasn\u2019t going to be enough. I think what they\u2019re doing is the right decision. It\u2019s just up to what they do with Russ now.", "Schroder is not a building block", "He\u2019s Serge tier on my list of players. They even shared the same number \ud83d\ude2d", "Off Topic but the Westbrook slander I see the few times I check the comments on an Instagram are downright disrespectful and ugly. I saw someone genuinely believe Westbrook was a trash point guard who just has high usage and stat pads every game and doesn\u2019t care about winning which is why PG wanted out. Worst part is he got quite a few likes", "This is true and if grant has a bad year because he won\u2019t start in Denver we could always pursue him for less money", "I\u2019m sure he does. He\u2019s too old and he\u2019s absolutely way too good to fit our timeline. Could we have gotten more for him? Probably, but I think a trade now was the right move.\n\n*too old", "It\u2019s also the only asset we could move in to space and GAIN an asset, I think.\n\nNeeded to cut salary and paying draft picks to do so, when rebuilding, is not a great option", "Most of our team has been gone since our first round \"peformance\" vs Portland", "For sure! We\u2019ve just been so spoiled, it\u2019ll be interesting how our the city and fan base embraces the rebuild", "We are not giving up all those picks to trade Westbrook. Worst case scenario, we trade Westbrook at the trade deadline to a team needing that extra boost to make some noise in the playoffs.", "Grant is actually a solid piece even for a rebuild because he's young and his contract can be considered expiring if they don't consider him part of future plans. That Denver pick is not going to be very good, in a draft class that's not going to be very deep. It's unnecessarily losing a good player for little more than adding to the stash of picks. That said, it does shave off a lot from the luxury tax bill.", "Not a franchise player for sure, but you have to realize that once WB is gone, our team is really young. Need someone there to at least help nurture the younger players/provide some solid output in the meantime", "Yep below Russ, Nick, Adams, and maybe Felton", "Yeah don\u2019t fucking forget that he\u2019s the reason we made the playoffs 3 years ago and weren\u2019t the worst team in the league. And I\u2019m serious, we had a shitty roster then. One of the greatest single seasons in NBA history. There\u2019s a reason he was an MVP. I understand a lot of the criticism (and tend to agree with it often) but you CANNOT discount what he\u2019s meant to this franchise, and even more what he\u2019s meant to the city. He gave us hope after KD left us in the dust with what we thought was nothing. He committed to us long term. He means everything to OKC. For better or for worse, he the EMBODIMENT of OKC Thunder basketball. And he deserves whatever the fuck it is he wants right now. He\u2019s more than earned that right.", "If you picked PG getting traded to spark a firesale then you are on another plane of existence. But you didn't, so sit down nephew.", "Yeah I\u2019ve been around since that lakers series, so I\u2019ve only seen this team miss the playoffs once. But I\u2019m an Oklahoma state fan so I\u2019m no stranger to disappointments and losing lmao", "Not saying all picks. Just saying he now has more flexibility. Take Westbrook and a nice 1st and give player(s) and pick(s). Make his salary more palatable. Agree that he\u2019s not going to give up much more.", "What's the point in keeping a guy for a rebuild if he's leaving at the end of the year? The late first rounder is worth more than having him for a year then losing him.", "As the other comment said, Grant was almost for sure going to leave at the end of the year. He\u2019s not going to stick around in his prime on a rebuilding team. If there\u2019s any chance he\u2019s gonna leave, might as well get an asset for him. I don\u2019t think rebuilding and gathering tons of assets is throwing in the towel though.", "No kd?", "Big true", "I never said anything about PG. I most definitely did say we would be rebuilding after we got wrecked though. I thought it would be a Westbrook trade to be fair to your point but I never said anything about PG in my post.", "I\u2019m a Razorback fan, so I feel you on that one. I am no stranger to misery.", "I mean we are going to have to take on salaries for the trade anyways  so we would just get some players dumped on us.

I sense the sarcasm", "Must've been just between you and your uncle, because there ain't shit on your post history.   \n\n\nMaking out like you knew it all and the last 3 days were inevitable just pisses me off more than I already am.", "bc he\u2019s a massive contract that most teams won\u2019t want", "No, I dont live and breathe Reddit in case that isn't obvious. And what is there to be pissed about? That's a little bit sad when you think about this situation. Again, I never said I knew it all but I did think a rebuild was a likely outcome and if you didn't I am curious to know why? Our team was beyond inconsistent, had back to back seasons which were complete failures, and really did not fit in the current picture of the NBA. Furthermore everyone in the West continued to get better and we had no cap space to do anything besides trade an overpriced player or give up one of our few appropriately priced key pieces. I can keep on going but its going to be about how the tension was clearly mounting for some time and last year's post season implosion made it clear to a lot more people than just me. Im not claiming Im the only one who knew this again so your hostility is a bit weird.", "And we would have to take on multiple contracts that they don\u2019t want to get in the same salary range to make the trade work. So they would trade in a few smaller contracts + maybe a pick or two / a young player and they would get an All-Star"], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

He has one bad stat game and we pegging him for the 3's. Not to mention pg has been shooting poorly from 3 as well this playoff so far. WB had at least one game where he shot from 3 well.\n\nAnd to your point yea I agree. 29% from 3 is awful. Straight up awful. But remember he had a slump somewhere between early december and february where it wasn't just 3's, but he was generally inconsistent. Literally one game where he goes off and next game hot garbage. \n\nBut since the beginning of march, he has been shooting 3's at 33%. From the beginning of the season to the end of february, he shot 26% from 3. So he has been shooting from 3's better recently and if you continually watch his games you would notice that too.\n\nHere is another thing people don't consider enough. The percentages of games a player has shot a well or a certain percentage from 3. Why do I mention this? Because I think it is fair to say that not every shot taken throughout the season is equal. I think we all know that, lineups matter, slump matters, approach to the game and other factors as well. And I think it is fair to say that there are times when a player is likely to be better or worse performance wise. And I think it is reasonable to set them off by games to show another optic.\n\nI think we can all say that 35% from 3 is not too bad. From beginning of the season to the end of february, he had 15/53, or 28%, of games where he shot at or above that percentage. Now from the beginning of march to the end of the season, he had 8/20, or 40%, of games where he shot well from 3.\n\nSo now let's put these numbers into perspective. Paul George from the start of march to the end of the season shot about 35% from 3. So as a reminder, about 2% better than WB did. However, he shot well 7/18 games, 39%. Also note that this calculation here had 2 less games because he missed 3 games from the start of march while WB missed only 1. And even if we included the 2 games right before march, that actually brings these numbers down lower. Now with these numbers am I saying WB is just as good as PG in shooting 3's? Hell no! PG was AMAZING from 3 earlier on this season. We know he has been playing kinda hurt and can kinda tell kinda tell from this playoff so far. So why bring these numbers up? Because the WB and PG we are getting are more likely to be the one's in the last 20-ish games. Recency shows us an interesting optic.\n\nLet's take a look at a different optic. Stars aside, what about ferg and grant. Grant is actually shooting 40% from 3 since the beginning of march and has a 10/21 games where he shot the 3 well which is a whopping 47%. Ferguson has 33% for both his average from the month and games where he shot the 3 well. 7/21. The reason I bring these two up is outside of PG, these are the guys we consistently put the 3 ball in the hands of and we trust that shot. And so far based off of recent events, I would say get the ball in the hands of grant for the 3. But I think it also shows not to blow the idea of WB shooting 3's in the playoffs out of proportions.\n\nWhat about schroder? 33% from 3 on average since march. Oddly enough, also 10/21. So maybe another player whose 3 we should respect more as well.", "Pulled in King Flop\u2019s face last game and then talked shit what you mean???", "You say that as if the rest of the team was able to shoot. \n\nAlso as if they weren\u2019t taking good shots. They totally were, they just were ice cold.\n\nWe won game 3 entirely because of Westbrook. Pick a different day to criticize his play from your armchair pls", "Gtfo you coward", "This is a shit take. The whole team has been dreadful. PG has underperformed in every game, Adams has looked 2nd rate for all but a few mins and Grant and Ferg have been absent outside of game 3. Its easy to blame one player, but our team just kind of sucks. At this point it has less to do with leadership, coaching etc. and more to do with the fact that our roster is a crock of shit in the modern NBA and Portland is just playing better across the board.", "Fun fact: Meyers Leonard, who is 7\u20191\u201d, did not record a single block during the 17-18 season", "Lol he's dramatically bigger than me but god damn that was the least intimidating roar I've ever heard", "He\u2019s a fake tough guy, he wasn\u2019t like that when he came into the league", "Oh comon, don't give me that homer shit.

Kobe is great at basketball, but I don't think he's great with advice. That advice will work with great shooters who get into a slump. That advice is awful for bad shooters who can never get good.

Think the Heat would rather walk than give up young talent, destroy the rest of their cap, and take on Westbrook and his faults.", "[deleted]", "We're okay with keeping Russ. Us Thunder fans understand the situation Russ is in. He is aging on a team that about to start a rebuild. The issue is that we want some quality assets in exchange for Russ (+ another player potentially). I'm talking a reasonable combination of picks and players. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nImagine if Chris Bosh left when Lebron did and the Heat wanted a rebuild. D-Wade would be in Russ' spot. You'd want something good in his place.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Happy Cake Day!", "Yes we are. We can trade him down the road if we can't deal him this summer. There are suitors for him. Its just that those teams can't trade for him now because of recently signed contracts. I bet the knicks would be interested. Houston would propose a deal as well. MIN, Bucks maybe Spurs could be interested. MAYBE Russ said that MIA is an intriguing destination for him if he gets traded BUT he never demanded a trade.. and our GM is not stupid enough to just give an MVP for free even if OKC owes a lot to Russ. Sam is also hesitant to deal with MIA because it could jeopardize the picks you guys owe us. So he's exploring this for Russ but then again, Russ never demanded to be traded.\n\nWhat I was wondering is why are you so against trading for Russ for lets say a package of Winslow and Herro? Russ can push you to a top 3 team in the East. With Winslow and Herro  you guys would be behind Bucks Philly Pacers maybe Toronto and BKN. Theres still a lot of quality FA that could fill your roster if you guys went thin cause of the trade... Korver, Livingston, Shumpert, and Iggy if he gets bought out to name a few.. Fitwise? With Spo, Russ' game would step up to the next level, trust me. A good coach is something Russ never had. Jimmy would push Russ and Russ would push Jimmy. I'm scared to think of the idea that if Russ gets traded, MIA fans would not love him wholeheartedly just like how we love him because you guys are so divided to surrender assets for him.

Russ can push you to a top 3 team in the East.\n\nBecause why trade young, promising talent for an aging star on one of the worst contracts in the league?

How much hardware did y'all win with Harden, Westbrook and Durant? I'll wait. \ud83d\ude02\n\nHerro is a rookie who was drafted 13th overall (who was questioned as to being picked too high).

Exactly why the Miami Herald has called it a stalemate.", "Understood, we\u2019re on the same page, I\u2019m getting downvoted for speaking the truth unfortunately.\n\nUntil there are more suitors, the Heat are in the position of power. There is no pressure to get this deal done at this time. \n\nRiley isn\u2019t going to just attach the young assets to get it done when he may be cheaper at the deadline. It also may backfire as his value might appreciate if the Heat find themselves competing for the conference with just Butler.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think Winslow will be the deciding factor.", "No takers.  LOL.  Morey is an absolute madman.", "Because with west brook you know what you are getting.  With young promising talent you never know what you are getting.  \n\nWestbrook is  walking triple double.

Havent heard the news about their surgeries? Besides its not just Russ and Paul were the reason why we had a disappointing season. Roberson was injured, abrines left and Presti failed to replace him. Also as if Jimmy doesnt have issues as well. Lastly I think MIA is one Westbrook away from being a top 3 team on the east. Without him, you're team is a 6-8 team on the east. Take note you guys lost a 10-10 guy...\n\n\nOH AND RUSS WAS TRADED ALREADY SO GOODLUCK BEING A 6-8 SEED. HOPE HERRO PANS OUT FOR YOU GUYS.", "Oh this hasn\u2019t aged well has it", "Don't listen to this guy, he doesn't represent us well.", "You don\u2019t know that. We just know he\u2019s open to it.\n\nYou really think Russ would rather go to a perennial loser like the Knicks with nothing to work with around him?\n\nIt needs to be a good team or he won\u2019t leave.", "Yeah but as much as I love Russ and want to do good by him, we aren't gifting him to you.  Which shouldn't matter because you don't want him that bad anyways right?", "Have you looked at the east?\nJimmy alone takes you to the playoffs...", "if i were presti i'd be fine just walking away with herro + salary matching stuff from those three and call it a day", "No, you're getting down voted for saying the Heat are in a position of power. You have also said its a stalemate. Both can't be true.

The fact that his teams seem to get bounced in the playoffs doesnt help either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are a lot of what-ifs for either scenario. Thankfully the Heat FO seems to be in the right mindset by holding back on their young talent.

On *my* Thunder sub?", "Were 1 of 3 teams with reported interest and the only one who has given an offer at that. \n\nKnowing that OKC wants to give Russ up and until someone else gets involved, how can you maintain that the Heat aren\u2019t in the power position?", "we're not tho...", "Well we did good by Russ and got picks.

My dads side of the family is from Brooklyn. \n\nHe grew up a Dodgers fan and was heartbroken when they moved to LA. He always wanted another team in BK. \n\nHe died in 2006 and I decided I\u2019d be a fan of whatever the next team in BK was. It turns out that was the Nets in 2012\n\nA couple years after he died, but before the Nets moved, I became a fan of basketball. The reason? Russell Westbrook. Dude was my favorite player to watch. Someone I\u2019d stay up for anytime he was on TV. So I decided I\u2019d be a thunder fan\n\nTo this day, I still consider myself a huge thunder fan. It\u2019s just, as a tribute to my dad, the Nets are first. \n\nAs a thunder fan, I fucking HATE Durant. Not just for costing us that series, but for bailing on us that winter to chase a ring. They had built something in OKC and he turned his back on it. And worse yet, to this day he still talks as if he was joining some scrappy underdog. Or that he was responsible for their success. \n\nFast forward a little \n\nThe team I root for now has the flat earther that I didn\u2019t like, they traded away LeVert, one of my favorite players, for a dominant force in Harden, but someone whose flopping play style I didn\u2019t like.\n\nAnd even worse, Durant.

And all the negatives about him, Thunder fans are going know all that stuff, and that\u2019s all well deserved. But I\u2019ve gotta throw some positives from this series his way.  \n\nKD straight up balled out.  His Big 3 became a Big 1.  And he rose to the occasion.  He played out of his mind this series.  I can\u2019t help but think what someone like LBJ would\u2019ve done if his Big 3 in Miami got injured except for him.  When he saw the writing on the wall, that it would be really difficult to win a championship, I don\u2019t think he fights as hard. KD has the NBA\u2019s best 3 point shooter (by %) 2 of the last 3 seasons in Joe Harris who seemingly can\u2019t buy a bucket. I never saw KD do the yelling/acting passive aggressive at him like LBJ does. I never saw KD laying the groundwork in the media about how he has an excuse for not winning like LBJ does. LBJ talks about his big shoulders being made to carry the team after AD is injured, and then he has a relatively sub par game. KD knew that winning the series was going to be on his shoulders and just balled out and let the game do the talking. So I\u2019ve got a lot of respect about that.  \n\nAnd the biggest thing\u2026after being so invested in that series, even though he rose to the occasion and balled out when his team needed him, even when he has to carry the disappointment of likely the best team on paper not winning because of injuries, even after he misses the shot to win the game and series\u2026when the game is immediately over after that missed shot, he goes and gives love to the opponents.  He gives love to Tucker, who guarded him primarily.  You think Russ is sticking around after the game after he misses the game winner in such an emotional situation? Or LBJ? I seriously doubt it. \n\nSo I get thunder fans (me included) have every right to not like the guy for the snakey things he does\u2026but I\u2019ve got nothing but respect for the way he handled himself this series.", "On this joyous day, me and my son Timmy got to watch Durcant fail miserably.

That \u201cthey are pro players who can do it on their own.\u201d In fact that example with the PG play running is quite a good one, because it shows that he likes to play in the rhythm of the game, supporting this theory. \nThe players have much more influence than they may seem, especially when it\u2019s Russ, already a volatile personality who has all the leverage in the world, having essentially rescued the franchise from complete irrelevancy.

When it came out that he was leaving the Spurs I thought \"that would be nice but lol not happening.\" There were rumors that the Warriors were after him, I'm pretty sure he went to the same high school as Kerr.\n\nHell yeah! Awesome offseason!\n\nEDIT: Found a cool article about him from 2014: https://grantland.com/features/the-shot-doctor/\n\n>Engelland didn\u2019t remake Kerr\u2019s shot \u2014\u00a0he didn\u2019t need to \u2014\u00a0but he became a trusted voice for keeping Kerr\u2019s fundamentals solid, while making minor changes to Kerr\u2019s already-legendary stroke. \u201cIt was very subtle,\u201d Kerr told me, \u201cbut before I started working with [Chip], the ball rolled more off my middle finger than my index finger. He taught me to spread my hands out a little wider on the ball and use my index fingers more.\u201d Kerr says\u00a0that switch made him\u00a0a more consistent shooter by allowing him\u00a0more control over his shot and making\u00a0it far less likely that the ball would slip and roll off his pinky fingers. It\u2019s hard to imagine that tiny shift of weight even being perceptible to an observer, but Kerr noted that Engelland is capable of seeing things in a shooter\u2019s motion that even Kerr, the league\u2019s most accurate 3-point shooter ever, wouldn\u2019t notice.\n\n>\u201cHe understands that a big part of shooting is the shooter\u2019s mind,\u201d Kerr said, and a moment toward the end of Kerr\u2019s career provided such an example. With Kerr playing reduced minutes in Portland as a 36-year-old during the 2001-02 campaign, he found himself struggling to stay loose for meaningful shooting opportunities. Kerr told Engelland about his problem and the shooting expert\u00a0flew up and offered a solution: a 30-minute, seven-shot workout. Kerr and Engelland would sit alone on the bench in the Portland practice facility after everybody else had left. Engelland would ask Kerr to tell him what was going on with his kids or even leave him\u00a0to read a newspaper. After a few minutes, Engelland would shout at Kerr to go, and the two would sprint off the bench and set Kerr up for a single 3-point attempt from the wing before returning to the bench. Repeat six more times and you\u2019ve got the league\u2019s most unlikely \u2014 and simultaneously most logical \u2014 shooting workout. A typical shooting coach, Kerr said, would have noted his\u00a0struggles and told him to take 200 shots from a variety of spots to try to\u00a0regain his physical rhythm. Instead, Engelland put himself in Kerr\u2019s shoes to help refresh Kerr\u2019s mental timing.", "Absolutely fucking massive. \n\nWow. \n\nSam Presti strikes again.", "Presti truly the best GM", "Damn, this sub willed it to fruition\u2026.", "Massive W\n\nSide note: Presti was a San Antonio product and now he\u2019s poaching their staff from them lmao", "This is awesome.

Pretty much every time I've found myself talking about the team, I've been complaining about their lack of shooting and hoping they would just clean house on their development staff. With this current rebuild and so many of the new guys really needing to develop their shot to reach their potential, I was really worried we were just going to repeat old mistakes. Obviously there's no guarantee any of them improve but this is such a HUGE get for the team and a really great sign that Presti is focused on a new approach for the roster.

It's not possible unless KD comes back.", "He literally averaged 8.5 a game for a season, which is why I said that. His role is not the same as Westbrook's in their offense, but has the ability to do it. He is just not asked to do it currently with who they have on the team. Westbrook is doing everything he can, which is great, but he is just too ball dominant and too inefficient. Never going to win a title if he doesn't change his mentality. I'm sorry, he is a great player, but the NBA today is too talented to win with him dominating the ball. That's why any sane person would take Steph on their team over Russ.

Yes, great guy. Lots of great guys played for the Thunder. Some stuck around a few years. Collison also happened to be a great guy.\n\nBut no one else can claim what Collison can claim about his relationship to the Thunder. Because of this, he was honored with his number in the rafters.

Westbrook hasn't even sniffed a conference title since Durant left. Honestly, what evidence is there to support otherwise when supposedly lesser players than him are getting farther in the playoffs.\n\nHow could it be argued that he is a championship caliber player when he can't get out of the first round with other all stars backing him up, minus his year where Harden got him to the second round but no further.", ">even still the Lakers roster isn't good enough to win it all yet\n\nWhat? Are you high? They just won it two years ago while beating the current champions. They spent a chunk of the year unhealthy. A healthy, full season with their stars and they are one of the best teams in the West. This is almost no different than Durant. He is maneuvering himself to a title winning powerhouse.", ">Not winning or making it to the conference finals the one year you have a semi-normal team does say something when you\u2019ve been declared one of the best to ever play the game.\n\nSo then this logic has to apply to Westbrook too, who can't seem to get out of the first round without some help and even sometimes with help. By this logic, it's arguable that Westbrook is drastically overrated, moreso than Durant.\n\n>A third wheel isn\u2019t paid 40+ mil a year. He didn\u2019t get a pay cut to accommodate and squeeze his way in to \u201can easy championship\u201d.\n\nThat's because it's not possible. But don't think that the Lakers are happy to pay 40 million to a guy who's known for sinking his team in the playoffs. If they could cut his salary in half, trust me, they would. Very few contracts in the league are worse than Westbrook's. He's not the worst, for sure. But it's bad. This is why he has been getting moved every year since he left OKC. For 40 million a year,  he doesn't make his teams much better. Houston saw no improvement and Washington saw slight improvement but not $40 million dollars worth. \n\n>I\u2019m saying he now has a chance to go home and see what happens on a legit contender.\n\nAnd I'm saying that if he was the player that this sub touts him to be, every team that he would be on would be a legit title contender. Other players would be flocking to him to get that ring. They aren't and teams are passing him around because what he brings to the table doesn't offset his horrible contract.", "just make sure you're their for the jersey retirement game", "What???? \n\nRuss is an all star all nba but no one has ever said he\u2019s the best player in the league. Just by that merit Durant is more overrated since he hasn\u2019t showed anything without the splash brothers by his side yet he\u2019s declared top 10 players to EVER play. Granted, it was 1 year of playing but he didn\u2019t accomplish anything in regards to his greatness. No more than the average player & team out in the first couple rounds. Russ also hasn\u2019t gotten far but he has more years without MVP players around him. Russ hasn\u2019t had warrior players by his side. Good/great guys but never a Curry or Klay. The one year he and Harden played they made it to the 2nd. \n\n\n\nIf the Lakers weren\u2019t happy paying him 40+ mil then they wouldn\u2019t have paid him. He wasn\u2019t drafted or forced upon them. They could have kept shroeder or went after Ball. There are other PG options out there wayyyyy cheaper than WB. Why are you pretending to know that that they\u2019re not happy about. No gun to anyone\u2019s head. The Lakers are established enough they don\u2019t have to take shit from no one. \n\n\n\nThe people on this sub likes him as a player. Again, no one said he\u2019s top 10 dead or alive. He\u2019s had great teammates. If he wasn\u2019t also great those teams wouldn\u2019t have traded to play with them esp with his contract. Onto his 4th team and they traded him for a package. \n\n\n\nHarden is one of the best shooters ever.. who \u201cflocked\u201d to Houston? \nGiannis current champ former mvp\u2026 who \u201cflocked\u201d to Milwaukee? \nWho\u2019s running to Portland to play with Dame?? Another great player.\n\nEvery single team is built from what works & what they\u2019ll sacrifice for. Oh and MONEY. Plenty greats would dominate together but it won\u2019t work with contracts. \nSo what exactly are you saying?", "Absolutely \ud83d\ude01", ">So what exactly are you saying?\n\nYou don't know what I'm saying?

Shooting motion is a very delicate thing, even if something was slightly different than pre-surgery I can definitely see how it would affect his shot.\n\nStill no excuse for all those turnovers either.

We then get bounced in the first-round, and he runs off to join a superteam in LA.\n\nI don't think OKC fans \"hate\" him. He could have left in free agency, and completely screwed us over. The fact that he re-signed so we actually got a good return for him makes me thankful. But the fact that he ran off to join a superteam makes him a bit of a coward.", "Bingo. Way too many emotional, irrational fans in this sub..", "What do you mean only one is tradable? Even if you want to say Westbrook is not, which i think thats silly. Gordon definitely is. 18M/yr for an experienced vet who can be a sixth man... yah, someone will take him.", "Eh ... EG is also arguably very overpaid and on the wrong side of 30 right? I'm not sure who'd want him either. IMO the rockets are who they are at this point.", "Because of Jokic", "And him leaving got us 2 starters (one which we hail as our future) AND 3 first round draft picks. For playoff P. Yeah, I\u2019ll take that trade every time. And it wouldn\u2019t have happened if PG didn\u2019t do the sign and trade. He helped us a lot.", "PG did us dirty but him getting us all these valuable assets did deserve standing ovation lol", "Do you have any concept of reality? PG netted us a team changing haul of picks and players by signing on long term. His value was the highest it ever has been when we traded him - if he didn\u2019t want to be here I call that about as win win as it gets.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t resign then we would have been left with a depleted roster and no picks to show for it. Cmon man", "The means matter more than the end. Why they left makes all the difference. One left to the team that we were up 3-1 against that previous playoff round. The other left after two years to join a new star on a new team and gave us a ton of pics and Shai. \n\nKD - Snek\n\nPG - Fool", "He realized that business was going to stay unfinished.", "He was never gonna stay all 4 years and the Thunder knew that. Presti did him a solid with a long term contract. PG could've leaked info to the Clippers and gotten us a worse deal. I assume him letting Sam handle it without tampering was part of the deal.", "Or he realized what people have been saying for years, that nobody can play with Westbrook and he was not going to win a championship here. He can want certain things at the time that he wants them and then realize that what he wants isn't going to be a reality and shift his focus. That's what he did. \n\nWhile he left to join a \"super team,\" it was known that he wanted to go play in LA for at least 2 years before he actually went and did it. Not his fault both LA teams have positioned themselves to win now.", "If you don't want him why would anyone else?", "You really think Westbrook is tradeable? 3 years left on his deal I believe at 43 mil per year ... until he's an expiring contract, who in their right mind would take that on? As much as I will always love and appreciate Russ, I sure AF would not want to have his contract atm. Will be very interesting to see what happens but he's at risk of really falling off a cliff. He still can't shoot and at some point his athleticism will wane. And at that point his career is essentially over.", "Well yeah Jokic really looks out for Grant, so maybe with Millsap aging he'll be the starter soon", "His intention was not to build us a future lmfao. His intention was to go join a \u201csuper team\u201d ASAP. Presti deserves ALL the credit for that.", "So Sam Presti should get the credit for that. Not the ring chaser.", "Alright, I\u2019ll concede. KD is the one true snake, and I guess Thunders are okay with PG leaving given the circumstances. Is it still kosher to bash him, though?", "trading KD wouldn't even be an option. you ride it out and go all in for one more shot because he's a top 15 player all-time\n\nOKC was not as reluctant with PG and Westbrook when they couldn't get out of the 1st round", "PG sux yo. What are you going on about. Nobody hates him. He just kinda was shitty, which is exactly PG. No biggie.  No one cares what he did or didnt realize", ".... Because the NBA is not a monolith?", "Every year GMs become desperate to keep their jobs and make questionable moves. And we always see GMs with an ego that tells them they can do things others could not. I would be more shocked if Westbrook could not be traded.", "Then he could have done what KD did and left us high and dry. Do you not remember that?", " presti should get the credit for sure but remember PG\u2019s documentary about his decision? If he leaves us for the lakers that summer we are completely fucked and he didn\u2019t plain and simple. Maybe they had a deal in place that if they weren\u2019t competitive that next season they would discuss blowing up the team. regardless, signing long term with us changed the outlook of our whole franchise from bleak to pretty damn bright...", "Yeah it is, fuck KD. \n\nOnly thing that'd fix his image for us is returning and getting a ring, not that'll happen. But for real man I loved KD and if he joined any team *except* Golden State we'd been cool, even if he joined LeBron it's been significantally better than the team that beat us in the Western Finals when we had a 3-1 lead, and helped the narrative he was recruited during the series.", "Yep. Free game.", "I mean sure could someone like Elton Brand trade for him? Of course. Someone will always bite. But will Houston get any real assets back for him now? I doubt it. But you're right, I'm not an NBA GM either.", "I think his point is that PG wasn't an unrestricted free agent.", "Snake is too full of himself riding the wave of whatever team will be decent the next year to come back to OKC and redeem himself. And personally I don\u2019t want him back anyways.", "If they do the smart thing and ditch Harden, they really wouldnt need to get some major haul for Westbrook.", "That\u2019s exactly my point. Thanks. Either way I\u2019ll chill on PG, his departure was a delicious gift. I\u2019ll give him that. Nobody here misses him"], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

The Thunder didn't STEAL your team....the city of Seattle didn't pay up. Simple as that. If they would have paid up when initially asked i wouldn't be a fan today as id have nothing to root for.\n\nIts why the MAPS 4 had the renovation baked into it....just to ensure us taxpayers don't get any ideas to not pay up as the owners basically are living rent free using a city owned facility", "Honestly, I\u2019d love for Seattle to get an expansion team if the NBA does decide to add teams. I understand how as a basketball fan, I\u2019d be crushed if the Thunder was taken away. \n\nBetter to let them have their team and put this all to rest, so we don\u2019t have to continue associating with them.", "Maybe they'll get a team in the next round of expansion and finally quit whining. I get their salt with Bennett and David Stern, but it's not like most OKC fans are going out of their way to shit on Seattle. \n\nThey've got a fancy new arena now that Bezos helped them build for their new NHL team next season.

Also can't help but feel sorry for Seattle fans, even when they're nothing but assholes in here lol. Completely understandable though tbh", "Then they are not fans of basketball if they can not appreciate Dort.", "Fellow Thunder fan in Seattle. There is still salt here for the Thunder, but I won't get shit on for wearing Thundet gear (mostly because everyone here is antisocial)", "I'm also a Thunder fan living in Seattle, and no one ever comments on my OKC gear.", "I live south of Seattle, and I've gotten a few comments when I'm wearing Thunder gear, but it's mostly friendly not actual anger.", "Its hard to blame them for being salty tbf", "Yes we\u2019d have no idea about being salty. Look at how badly we took KD leaving, we\u2019d probably be just as bad as Seattle fans if the Thunder went to Vegas or something.", "I'm just gonna assume you're young and have no clue what happened", "The factors that moved the team from Seattle weren't really within the fans' control. Calling them salty is a but disingenuous. They got robbed. If somebody took something away from you that you loved and there was nothing you could do about it, you probably wouldn't ever forget it.", "Sonics fans also like to forget that there had been rumblings of the team moving because it wasn\u2019t being properly supported by the city, who to be fair had just built new arenas for the Seahawks and Mariners and weren\u2019t keen on spending that kind of money yet again. The history of Key Arena is pretty interesting in and of itself as well. Because of the way it was designed and the way stadiums were heading, it was an outdated arena within 5 years of being built.\n\nSo there\u2019s that, coupled with OKC hosting the Hornets after Hurricane Katrina and the league being very impressed with the local support for a team that we had no connection to. To the point that David Stern said OKC had jumped to the top of the list for any NBA franchise looking to relocate. \n\nThen with that in mind, Howard \u201cStarbucks\u201d Schultz sells the Sonics to an OKC based ownership group. They say they plan to keep the team in Seattle as long as certain expectations are met (which they were unlikely to be), and when they weren\u2019t met, they moved the team to OKC, which was what everyone with a brain knew was gonna happen as soon as Schultz sold the team. There was a headline on the front page of the sports section of the Daily Oklahoman when Schultz sold the team asking how long it was before the team moved to OKC. That was a year or more before a move was announced, that\u2019s how obvious it was. \n\nSonics fans like to cry about the renovations to Key Arena being more than the renovations we did to what was then the Ford Center. But they don\u2019t ever look at that cost of living and cost of construction are very different in Seattle vs. OKC. They don\u2019t look at the context I just laid out for how Howard Schultz gave away their team. I think the salt won\u2019t go away until Seattle has their team back. You know Cleveland was really salty about the Browns moving to Baltimore and that was a much shittier situation. But there\u2019s not as much salt now between Browns and Ravens fans because Cleveland got the Browns back. So I\u2019m assuming the same will be true when Seattle gets a team again and inherent back all the Sonics history, which they deservedly will as part of the relocation agreement.", "Sonics fans like to conveniently forget this point.", "I hope they get their own team again and it would be best if it came from expansion as I never want to see a city lose their team...but it would be ironic if they did get a relocated team and had to defend supporting them after the last decade-plus of, at least some, of their fans shitting on Thunder fans for supporting the team.", "cuz the thunder got brought into it, which qualifies this to the sub", "It is not a good vibe for such a good vibe sub.", "Ah, back when fans actually went to Sonics game. Same fans that left halfway through the 201 NFCCG", "But OKC's basketball team > Seattle's basketball team.", "Yes I do love being rained on 325 days of the year. What a beautiful place Seattle is. Especially now after the riots lasting a year. Beautiful place. Can find piles of human shit in the street every day! Beautiful place Seattle is.", "[real talk](https://i.imgur.com/QiwADFl.jpg)", "Nor are they people of good culture, I say", "Yea I'm at a small college so people say things pretty often", "Probably because you seem unapproachable", "Self-induced TBH.  If you\u2019ll remember, OKC self-increased our taxes to build the (at the time) Ford Center.  And when Seattle, as a city, refused to upgrade the facility for the Supersonics, that\u2019s when ownership made the decision to leave.\n\nAnd that was AFTER OKC babysat the Hornets because of Hurricane Katrina.  We were expanding, we were advertising our expansion all over the NBA, and if Seattle didn\u2019t want to lose their team, they had every opportunity to try and keep them while we were looming large.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is, \u201cGet fucked, Seattle - we got ours.  Shoulda put your money where your loud ass mouths are.\u201d", "I know man. That's why that rumour about new expansion teams is good news for us and them. I will watch the fuck out of all the games we have against Seattle in the near future.", "This. They draft Cade and relocate. Just imagine.", "This is why you should never assume. Because your assumtpion is way off the mark and I know every bit of history about what happened more than a decade ago regarding the whole teams history.", "Nope! You are absolutely right. If I were in that position, I would likely hate Clay Bennett til I died. BUT, I wouldn't ever be a dick to fans of that team. It isn't their fault. Just like it isn't our fault, that we hosted an NBA team in need of a place to play, and showed how successful a pro sports team could do in OKC. Are we supposed to not root for them? I do genuinely feel bad for Sonic fans, but that doesn't give them an excuse to act like a bitch to me.", "Yeah to management, not a decade later still hating on another fan base for getting a team. It's not disingenuous to call them salty because they are, at the wrong people.", "If the Thunder were shadily stolen and moved to Nebraska, I wouldn\u2019t be actively rooting against them and trolling the fans on social media. It\u2019s fine to be sad that your team is gone, but there\u2019s no reason for the level of toxicity that currently exists with sonic fans towards the Thunder.", "Exactly.  You want to be mad, be mad at Schultz for selling the team.  Then, be mad at your local government not wanting to invest in the team's facilities.  \n\nIf people had been supporting the Sonics in the first place, they wouldn't have left.  Billionaires love one thing more than anything else...money.  If the team was supported like they should've been, the local governments stepped up with an incentive package and/or tax incentives or whatnot, then I guarantee you as a lifelong OKC resident, there's tons more money in Seattle than OKC and as an investment alone, the house money would've stayed with Seattle.  Just didn't go down that way.  \n\nPeople also seem to forget that once your own house is in order so to speak, good things do happen.  Look at the Baltimore Ravens.  They were the Browns who relocated from Cleveland.  Cleveland got it's chit together and now have their own Browns franchise again that I might add, is doing quite well thanks to Mayfield who's an OU grad.  See how that works?  Oklahoma be putting good into the world but I digress.  \n\nSeattle is very salty, OKC fans would love nothing more to embrace Soncis fans and welcome them to the Thunder family.  Kind of hard to do though with fans who hate your guts and assume it's your fault when it clearly isn't.", "[deleted]", "I mean if we\u2019re taking cheap shots than there\u2019s always the whole racism thing.", "Id have to agree, its time for a new haircut", "I feel pretty approachable. I think it's just a thing out here.", "Yes, let\u2019s all pay for the billionaires arenas, so fucking dumb", "yea fuck the indivual fans that had no say in what happened!!! Seattle should of been like OKC and spent their taxpayer money on entertainment for the upper middle class while lining billionaires pockets instead of actual public services.", "That first game the Thunder play at Seattle is gonna be bonkers.", "I honestly can't imagine being a complete dick 24/7 to the people of Vegas because the owner sold/moved our team.", "I didn\u2019t need this fear in my life this early in the morning", "When you assume, u make me eat ass", "Nailed it.", "Sure. But in this case, the troll was the Thunder fan so that goes out the window. You don't get to pour salt in their wounds and expect them not to clap back.", "What answer do you expect anyway? lmao", "You mean rasicm in Okc?? I live in Victoria, my assumption is that Oklahoma would have much more rasict per capita..", "It's the people's arena. It was owned by Oklahoma City when it opened. The people made the choice to pay extra to build an arena for themselves, not some billionaire.", "Chesapeake and Cox are both pretty solid buildings. While I agree it should be the people\u2019s decision, tons of events have happened that have benefitted local business, individuals, etc. I don\u2019t think building another random stadium for no reason and having the city pay for it is good. We\u2019ve seen it really do damage but this city has really grown and that event center complex is a part of that growth.", "Its funny that the Starbucks CEO did not want to pay for it.", "I\u2019m usually with this. but I\u2019m fine with tax money being used on things that i enjoy.", "Trust me I\u2019m with you.  Seattle fans got screwed, but as someone who has grown up in Oklahoma, these investments were a very good thing for the state. It\u2019s not a rich get richer thing, it\u2019s helped our overall economy a lot.", "Keep the limited view point if you want, but the Thunder showed up around 2008ish, and OKC grew by 15% populationwise when you get to 2018.  The economic growth around downtown alone was enough to fund multiple restaurants, the river cruise, the horse carriages, the segways, and the random vendors and musicians who would take advantage of those same Thunder Game visitors for over a decade.\n\nSeattle already had all of that stuff, and this may never matter to you if they were your team...but without the Thunder, OKC may have never been able to be as amazing as it is in 2021.  If you grew up here in the 90s, you know how much everything changed for the better during that time period, specifically...and part of it was because we were willing to tax ourselves in order to attract a pro basketball team to help grow our city.\n\nIf Seattle had put as much effort into retaining their team as we did attracting one, we could have snatched up a different one instead.  But they didn\u2019t, and the rest is history.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just about entertaining the upper middle class, kid.  It was about getting our city into the top 25 cities in the nation, and it worked.", "Wildly enough I\u2019d be pissed at the owner, and not misdirecting that anger to the fans that would welcome you with open arms.", "Except the Thunder fan was the one clapping back?", "Yes in Oklahoma", "Although Seattle does have a fair share of woke morons, I live here and I can\u2019t deny that.", "I think the Cox center is on its way out, now that we just built that nice new convention center south of the arena", "still childish to give a fuck you to the indivual fans that had no say", "They're all goofballs.", "Trying not to overly play Devil\u2019s advocate but the initial anger was definitely more with Clay Bennett and organisation generally. The feud has since been stoked, rightly or wrongly, by both sets of fans having a different idea of how defensive the other set of fans is allowed to be. \n\nIt\u2019ll never really be settled but I do wish that Thunder fans would have a little more empathy and that Sonics fans would be able to let Thunder fans enjoy what they have and appreciate it.", "Is it? I honestly don't know. Social media isn't a strong suit. I thought in this picture, the small reply was a response to the reply in the main window. No?", "Cox center is turning into a filming location, if rumors are true.", "Nah. It\u2019s confusing if you don\u2019t use Twitter, but you can \u201cquote\u201d someone else\u2019s tweet and then write your response above. So in this case, the Seattle reporter just tweeted that unprovoked and the Thunder fan clapped back.", "Oy. Well now I just feel old.

He's a pure shooter which means they can kick out to him all day, and Jabari will provide them space which makes Giddey and Shai themselves better. Jabari has big but underused bounce as well, but a knack for offball cutting, which is perfect for Giddey who will absolutely find Jabari whenever he cuts offball. I think it'll help Jabari put pressure on the rim and get paint buckets which is his biggest weakness. Plus his defense means he fits in naturally and will be able to play big minutes. Plus having our big three core be 6'9\", 6'6\", and 6'10\" is so freaking sexy.\n\nI like Chet as well, but he's more of a glue guy who's always in the right place rather than a Jabari-type of calling plays specifically for him.\n\nI think Paolo is by far the worst fit with Giddey and Shai. In fact, I'd actually say he's a bad fit with Giddey and Shai. Giddey and Shai are already having a hard time sharing the ball and they desperately want guys who will finish plays for them offball with shooting and rim finishes. Paolo is by far the worst longrange shooter for the three and is ball dominant to boot, so he'd take the ball out of their hands. I really really don't like the idea of Paolo doing triple threat stuff in the post while Giddey is wasted offball in the corner and Shai is unhappy standing at the top of the key without the ball in his hands.", "I like Jabari, finally having a point guard that will kick out to a 6\u201910\u201d sniper on the wing would be amazing", "Hoping he passes the personality test for OKC.

If all signs point to the Magic liking Jabari at #1, I hope Presti uses some of those assets to trade #2 for #1.\n\nRealistically, we need MVP-level players. The only teams to ever win a championship without a former/present/future MVP on the team are the Pistons (the Bad Boys and the 04 team).\n\nIf Chet works out, he'll be a great player; super helpful stretch big glue guy on offense who hits threes, makes smart passes, and finishes lob passes while providing all-defensive team level defense, but I don't see him in MVP conversations.\n\nJabari has that potential, I think. I think he's comparable to Paul George in terms of size, length, pure shooting, perimeter defense, and early struggles with dribbling and self creation. PG hasn't won a MVP, sure, but he's been a legitimate top five MVP candidate at times in his career and gave the big three Heat tough series as the #1 guy for the Pacers.\n\nIf Jabari develops a one-two-dribble pull-up to go along with his three point shot and his defense, that's a special player. If he develops a dribble game to attack close-outs and put pressure on the rim (he just turned nineteen last week, so he's got time), that's a superstar caliber player.\n\nIf we're just one pick away from getting him, I think you've got to go for it and cash in assets for him.

In his lottery might interview with ESPN, he said he wanted to show off more self-creation and implied he didn\u2019t get to in college, but I have a hard time seeing it. He doesn\u2019t have the burst to take guys off the dribble at his size, but he\u2019s also lacking the frame to be a post-up guy. His points seem like they\u2019ll be largely assisted: half-court catch and shoot threes in the corner, semi-transition catch and shoot threes above the break, paint finishes as a roll man, catching libs and dump-off passes in the dunker\u2019s spot.\n\nCoupled with his likely defense and passing, that\u2019s a super useful player, especially if he ever manages to play consistent minutes at the five. But I don\u2019t see the upside as another \u201cgive him the ball, let him score\u201d guy and we need another one besides Shai.\n\nJabari at least has that upside with his shooting touch, size, and youth. 100% agree that it\u2019s not there yet with him, but there\u2019s potential. Jabari has a 3-and-D floor, and at his age, he\u2019s got like five-six years of time to slowly develop a handle and a few go-to moves before he\u2019s in his prime at 25-26 years of age.

Lebron was cooking in those 2 playoffs", "I mean, we can go back to 7 minutes left in the 4th and we had a 15 point lead if you want to go that route. \n\nAnd yes, a lead like that that late in the game should be insurmountable, but we gave it up rushing possessions and giving them the time to come back. Don't be obtuse. That game was extremely winnable, Russ made mistakes, PG missed free throws, and our coach is totally incompetent, but they're all complicit in the loss and Russ deserves the shit he got for blowing it.\n\nAnd saying \"Oh but they were tied until Dame's shot\" is just ridiculous when we gave up that big of a lead.", "I appreciate your use of \u201cno way\u201d so let me say there is \u201cno way\u201d you know what the warriors could have done without adding KD.

On Game of Thrones?!\" Like have we been watching the same show all this time? The NBA is kinda like that except the exact opposite, there are no twists, and the thing you don't want to have happen is the thing that's going to happen. The warriors are going to win, because they're the warriors. That's why KD joined them, so they could carry his ass to bitch rings while he bragged about how he caused it all.

After the years of the picks got released all the people whoring for karma stepped back. People were trying to say we got fleeced somehow, but what else were we supposed to get for him? This is a much better deal for us than what we gave Indiana, even with how good Oladipo turned out to be. We are in rebuilding mode, which us Thunder fans haven't really been accustomed to. Outside of like the first 2 years after moving to OKC we've been top dogs in the league, hopefully the fans don't abandon the team as they can see what we are working towards.", "We turned a 6 month PG lease to 5 years of first round draft picks.

Don't get me wrong, I would've loved one more year considering the west was wide open but given the circumstances (I truly don't blame PG for leaving, Kawhi just won a chip as *the man* on his team and the clippers are a great organization under Doc, they got Bev and Lou Will too. I would've left if Kawhi was recruiting me in this situation tbh), Presti made the right call. I just hope we keep the brodie", "You guys are gonna be fine. I thought you had a better, or at least more equal shot this year even though its always the same bullshit every year but this time I think is the real change. You finally get to a build a real team around Russ instead of working with some busted ass cap space and taking what you can get. Drafting some nice consistent shooters, a solid big man that can do some shit, maybe keep Grant and Adams hopefully or send him to us lol cause I can't stand to see him anywhere else, and then maybe those picks pan out if the Clippers fall apart or PG and Kawhi move on and you guys get some crazy HS or generational prospect, maybe some crazy lottery shit goes down, or even just a good draft steal.

Dunno if Presti knew that Kawhi was contingent on PG going, but if he did I feel like he could've gotten more.  You give up anything 10x out of 10 if that opportunity falls in your lap, and I doubt LAC would've balked if we asked for Shamet too.", "Hes been a terrible GM though.

Technically I thought our chances would be better this year than last since Roberson is healthy and the Warriors are a MASH unit.", "You\u2019re absolutely right. OKC wasn\u2019t going to be competitive this year anyways, and now they are set up for the future", "He really did. I don't think this comes down to a Russ issue or a front office thing, I think Paul George wanted to play in LA. He said it when he was in Indiana and OKC still took a shot at getting him, and then they did enough to make him believe that he wanted to stay long(ish) term. \n\nUltimately, I think the feelings of wanting to play in LA came back and PG saw his opportunity and Presti seized his and got five first rounders and two pieces.", "Best deal ever, this could lead to a very bright future, hopefully the owners of the Thunder don't fuck it up again by trading away tremendous talent to stay under the cap. \n\n\nThis could also be the end of Westbrook era, if Presti can find a suitor. If not Westbrook, it will be Steve Adams, again, if there are possible suitors (which there may not be).", "I really don\u2019t understand why people think there was really any better option.

But also like Morey, when you look at long term performance the brilliance really isn't there.", "my biggest problem is all of the picks are gonna be 27th to 30th overall, this new clippers team is the new projected championship winner, so we are gonna end up with getting a couple 30th overall picks, maybe a 25th and a 10 ppg rookie and a Danillo Galanari on the back end of his career, that is my problem with the trade", "I kind of want to be angry, but honestly I'm just sad. This feels like the end of the Thunder being relevant for many years, if not forever. Hopefully all those draft picks turn into something, but given how cheap the ownership group is, at least they'll finally figure out if the Peake will still sell out if the team is trash for multiple years. To PG's credit, at least OKC was able to get something back unlike with Durant.\n\nRooting for this team just feels like a metaphor for living in Oklahoma writ large: some things may get better, eventually, but ultimately I'm still living in a mediocre state that's never going to really improve.

A lot of the blame (two thirds) has to go on the shoulders of Westbrook, donovan and scot brooks.

Harden, who is one of the most ball dominant players in league history, so that he fits next to Westbrook who is also one of the most ball dominant players in history? How would that have worked, exactly? Harden doesn\u2019t become the player he became if we keep him as the third option behind Russ and KD. And Presti \u201cgave away\u201d Harden? He didn\u2019t get back the pick that became Steven Adams, a highly regarded young player in Jeremy Lamb (who didn\u2019t become what he was capable of being but was a young guy worth taking a shot at), and a guy in Kevin Martin that had averaged 20+ ppg the previous 5 years or so? That\u2019s \u201cgiving away\u201d Harden?

Did you not see that he\u2019s the type of guy that would leave a place he just won two titles in three years with?

Because I legitimately cannot think of one good shooter that was available for the past couple seasons. We didn\u2019t have enough asset to trade for Avery Bradley, Wesley Mathews signed else where, Jr cost like 10+ mil a year, etc. He did the best he could in this aspect(Except for Bazley this year with some good shooters still on board).\n\nYou have to be realistic, and it\u2019s not Presti\u2019s fault that we\u2019re literally cursed by injury, majority of every decent FA we signed turns into crap, not having enough assets to trade for other stars because he went all in previously.", "If we build around tferg we'll never get back to 7th seed again lmao", "To be fair, I think you guys will move Westrbook, the PG trade is a nice first step, I don't think you guys are done, and I think you will be a lot more patient on Westbrook and Adams.

To trade them, we might even have to attach picks to them or take bad contracts back in return.\n\nEdit: Look, I know that this isn't the sub for this opinion, and I love the guy, just trying to be realistic. Just saw Zach Lowe's take on the matter, which is \"Westbrook's supermax, which will pay him $47 million in 2022-23, is a straight-up albatross. They may mind-trick some dumb team into taking it at some point, but the Thunder have to assume Westbrook carries negative trade value.\"", "To blame billy Donovan is just foolish.

I think it's important for okc's future as a free agent destination that it is known we will try to respect a player's wishes. Plus we did get a pretty huge haul for the trade.\n\nI do agree with you that pg13 fell off in the 2nd half, but it's also important to remember that we also had the easiest schedule in the NBA before the all star break.\n\nAlso, I dont think russ is an mvp type player any more. Maybe in the right situations he could shine again, but the man has completely lost his shot. Hes shooting what like 60% from the ft line and 29% from deep? Teams can just sag off him so easily. Maybe if he were surrounded by lights out shooters he could return to the old days, but hes on the wrong side of 30 so I kinda doubt it.\n\nI also dont think we were going anywhere. You mentioned the rockets and the warriors. Sure, that's great, but we could get past the jazz or Portland. We couldn't make it out of the first round.

He's signing those players, and he dug himself into a hole where he had no space to acquire shooters on a team that desperately needed them.

Russ was working on his shot for next year, he and PG had their surgeries early in the offseason for once, we were poised to do something great and Presti just gave up. \n\nI'm done talking about this, this was a horrible move and nothing will convince me otherwise.

Stayed home to play college basketball because of it. He gets drafted by a team that had yet to exist, and a city he knew nothing about in a state that was not a hotbed for NBA basketball. He came into a team that was one of the worst in the league and a roster where he wasn't the primary option. He worked his way up and improved each season. He constantly played second fiddle to Kevin, and even third to Harden occasionally. \n\nHarden gets traded after a Finals run that came up short. Russ and Kevin take it on their shoulders the next four years. Russ watches KD get the praise, while he gets the media's ire. He watches Kevin get the MVP and supports him. The team continues to come up short in the postseason though. \n\nFast forward to 2016. KD leaves for Golden State, the team they just lost to in seven games, even after Russ asked Kevin what he could do differently. Instead of asking for a trade or looking for an amicable departure, Russ re-signs and puts the organization on his shoulders for an incredible MVP campaign. Russ now takes on the primary role of the team's best player. \n\nPresti brings him Paul George and Carmelo Anthony. Even with all the uncertainty, Russ re-signs a long term extension and recruits PG to stay all season. The team never really adjusts to each though, and they underwhelm in the first round to the Jazz. \n\nRuss develops such a brotherhood with Paul George that it convinces him to stay in Oklahoma City for the remainder of his prime years while the duo chases a championship. Russ struggles with early injuries, and comes back slow offensively. Instead of trying to force himself, he adapts his game to make Paul George the primary option and also get Steven Adams more involved. Catch up to current time and the team is rolling at 20-10, PG is becoming an MVP candidate, Russ is spinning heads with his willingness to take a backseat and play the second option again, and the team altogether is playing the best they have in three years. \n\nI think the Thunder's current run is due to the buy in defensively, but also Russ deferring to PG. Those best Thunder years, Russ was playing second to KD (but was a little less patient about it). Now he's grown and matured and sees what the team needs to be successful. PG is playing the KD role, while Russ is playing secondary; even third on occasion. But to watch a guy grow and embrace a situation that didn't hold up well to keep him (small market, California kid, unproven team/city, sidekick leaves), Russ has chosen us time and time again. His loyalty and heart for our state is something we should never live down. This guy may not be the perfect player, but he IS Thunder Basketball.

He's been here since it all started; I think there's a level of pride there for him. \n\nPlus he likes the privacy and Oklahoma provides that a lot better than California would. ", "I mean you could make the argument. Russ was always the heart and soul of the team; always the leader. KD just got the big plays and recognition. But you're right, he's definitely put his stamp on the organization since then. I just like how he's deferring like he used to. ", "I got you. \n\nRuss and his best friend Khelcey grew up together playing basketball. Through HS, russ was sort of over shadowed by his best friend but it was deserved. Khelcey was supposed to be the next big thing. Many thought khelcey was the best HS player in the nation.  He was getting recognition and scouted all over the place.  He was a phenomenal player on defense and offense. He could rebound, steal, shoot threes, run the floor, sprint from coast to coast and nobody could keep up with him.  He wanted nothing more than for him and Russ to play ball at UCLA together and see where the league took them. \n\nAt 16, he played in LA's Drew League to showcase himself. Being that young, and getting invited to an event like that is very rare. He was doing his best to become a sensation and bring Russ alongside him. They grew up together playing ball.  They practically lived together. He was a huge part of Russ's life. Basically brothers.\n\nSadly, Khelcey wouldn't be there for russ when they went to UCLA. He wouldn't go to the NBA and play alongside Russ.  He wouldn't be there to help him practice his shot, play video games, hang out, or anything else.  He ended up dying at 16 years old from a heart attack. And the death shook his family and friends to the core. \n\nEspecially Russell Westbrook. \n\n(Enter Russ Stage Right)\nThis is where russ's story really began. He was a very average player in high school. Dont get me wrong, he wasnt bad by any means. But he was definitely was not the russ we know today.  However, the death of his best friend turned something on inside of him.  He knew Khelcey was supposed to be the star. Khelcey was the prodigy.  Khelcey was supposed to bring home championships, medals, have his name plastered all over...\n\nBut since Khelcey passed, Russ knew he had to play for not only himself, but for the late Khelcey Barrs III as well.  \n\nHe began doing things twice. Putting in twice the work.  Practicing twice as hard. Running twice as fast as anyone, bringing twice the energy, being the best he could be as twice the man he thought he was. \n\nIf I recall, russ's first year at UCLA was spent playing backup. He wasnt on anyone's radar. Nobody was watching him. He was just a back up who's primary concern was defense. Too early to tryout for the draft. \n\nHe stayed a second year where he was placed as a starter due to an injury on Darren Collisonn unfortunately. That year, russ was doing great.  Averaging 12.7 points, 3.9 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.7 steals, was named all PAC-10 third team and made PAC-10 defensive player the year...\n\nAfter his second year, he tried for the draft. \n\nNobody expected him to be anything more than a backup. \n\nTo this day, russ has a wall of achievements: \n\nNBA Most Valuable Player\u00a0(2017)\n\n7\u00d7\u00a0NBA All-Star\u00a0(2011\u20132013, 2015\u20132018)\n\n2\u00d7\u00a0NBA All-Star Game MVP\u00a0(2015, 2016)\n\n2\u00d7\u00a0All-NBA First Team\u00a0(2016, 2017)\n\n5\u00d7\u00a0All-NBA Second Team\u00a0(2011\u20132013, 2015, 2018)\n\n2\u00d7\u00a0NBA scoring champion\u00a0(2015, 2017)\n\nNBA assists leader\u00a0(2018)\n\nNBA All-Rookie\u00a0First Team (2009)\n\n\nCollege\n\n2008\u00a0All-Pac-10\u00a0Third Team[127]\n\n2008\u00a0Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year[128]\n\n2008\u00a0Pac-10 All-Tournament Team\n\n2008 Pac-10 All-Defensive Team\n\n2008 CollegeInsider.com All-Defensive Team\n\n\n\nAnd what makes it special, is he credits all of those achievements to the person whos name is engraved on the little rubber bracelet he wears to every game. \n\nKhelcey Barrs III", "But why harden he ain\u2019t do anything to us.", "What do you think the statue will look like?

When he won his championship he instantly became one of the most respected players ever, I really hope the same thing happens to russ, he deserves it. ", "Russ is a family man who has started faithful to his college girlfriend. KD made an impromptu proposal to a girl he dated and then proceeded to cheat on regularly. \n\nThis is just one example of the differences between them. ", "I think they both realized they were dads and this is an atmosphere you can raise your kids.

", "Thank you!!", "And he wasnt even offered a scholarship at UCLA at first. They only offered him a scholarship after one of their original recruits had backed out on them last second. He literally wasn't supposed to make it this far. Now hes a 2x scoring leader and assists leader and is on trajectory to add to that as the steals leader this year. Has been MVP and is basically averaging a triple-double over a 3 year span starting from midseason of KD's last year. He has exciting highlights from his entire career that range from electrifying dunks, insane dime passes, countless clutch time performances and wins with flashes of great defense whenever the game was on the line.

You brought that into this discussion yourself. It's a fallacy to point to other things that are wrong to somehow justify the Russ name-calling. No one is saying those things are okay.\n\nAnyway I think you're missing my point.. which is that it's not the intent that really matters, it's the consequences. Criticism is fair for any athlete who gets paid millions. Making fun of them, and by doing so their family--even if that wasn't your intent--is low. Family names are important to some people. What they're doing to Russ would be like us making fun of KD's mom because of his decision to leave. Even if people who say Westbrick only mean it for him, it's a name that belongs to his whole family. Criticize him all you want, but you should always take care not to bring people's family into it, even unintentionally.\n\nAnd you almost got there with KD. You only left out that the team he left for just had the best regular season ever, and he personally was in contact with players from that team during the WCF where they were recruiting him. He could've gone literally anywhere else, and, while it would've sucked, no one would've cared nearly as much.\n\nAlso, Jae Chowder is pure food-truck name gold.", "Lol Jesus, you can't even construct a proper sentence.

And again, I have no problem booing Simmons, or Russ or KD or Pat Bev or any of them.  Don\u2019t say racist stuff, keep the families out of it, but otherwise have at it.  That\u2019s my general my philosophy for professional athletes.  \n\nAnd I understand about emphasizing the consequences.  You talk bad about a family name, the family is saddened. You don\u2019t think when Wanda Durant was sitting courtside and beloved by okc and then they turned on her kid suddenly where he\u2019s getting booed mercilessly, that that didn\u2019t hurt her in some way? That\u2019s going to be a natural reaction of anyone\u2019s parent. So in your words, the consequence was his family got hurt\u2026so that\u2019s bad right? \n\nTo me, people are going to get hurt.

Harden wanted the max. We had no way to offer that other than not resigning Ibaka at all, or going into the luxury tax, which the owner didn\u2019t want to do. Everyone else was taking less than max deals for the team at the time. Harden wouldn\u2019t budge. Presti didn\u2019t have many options but to try and get as much value out of a 6th man up and coming prospect. If Presti would have known that Harden would have held out for max money and not bought into the team like everyone else taking lesser deals, I\u2019m sure he would have dealt with Harden first and done the Ibaka deal second. But locking up Ibaka on his deal was great for the team so he went ahead and made it. Then Harden said no to the max we could offer him under the cap. And Presti put Plan B into motion to get pieces and picks back immediately while his value was the highest. \n\nI would argue those picks and pieces weren\u2019t the best we could have gotten and that\u2019s where Presti is at fault, but not actually trading Harden.

You really think Presti didn\u2019t want to keep all those guys? \n\nOur options were pay into the luxury to keep him (off the table due to owners), keep him 1 more year and risk letting him walk for nothing(if he plays poorly we could keep him for less money, although the argument could be made we would have second guessed it at that point with Westbrook and Durant under contract), trade him immediately (we got a decent package for a 6th man prospect, I think we could have gotten better but I wasn\u2019t in the room with other GMs hearing his value on the open market), or trade him mid-season and likely get less return due to the expiring nature of his rookie deal and the fact that he was a prospect (he wasn\u2019t the MVP caliber Harden you see now).", "I\u2019m just telling you what KD said bro, not sharing my or anybody else\u2019s opinion", "Do you think PG has played like an MVP candidate recently?", "Nah man everyone knew he was a consensus top 2 pick with gigantic upside.

It was a lose lose situation because if he sits out the last month of the regular season we might've missed the playoffs but now he has to deal with pain every time he takes a shot.", "I misspoke because I haven\u2019t had to deal with this in nearly 7 years. It wouldn\u2019t have gone against the cap but it wouldn\u2019t have affected our situation:\n\nJuly 17th, 2012: The NBA\u2019s amnesty deadline passes. Kendrick Perkins remains with the Thunder. \n\nAt the time of all this, amnesty wasn\u2019t even an option. \n\nBut let\u2019s assume they did it earlier in the off-season.\n\n2012\u2019s NBA Salary Cap was $58 million, but the tax level was $70.3 million. We'll assume the same figures for the following season.\n\nThunder's cap that season was $68.92 million, so approximately $1.08 million shy of paying the tax.\n\nOnce you deduct Martin, Brewer, Fisher, Liggins and Orton's salaries, OKC's cap was at $52.98 million.\n\nBut of course, you have to add salary increases. So take that $52.98 million and add raises for virtually everyone else on the roster.\n\nOnce you factor in all the monetary changes for next season, OKC's new cap number was $66.1 million. They assumed the luxury tax would remain at $70.3 million, so the Thunder will be about $4.2 million shy of paying the luxury tax.\n\nIf the Thunder decided to amnesty Kendrick's contract ($8.48 million), they would sit at $57.6 million. That's only about $400,000 shy of crossing the cap ($58 million).\n\nAmnestying Perkins would have helped, but not that much.\n\nOf course, this all could have been avoided had Perk not received that four-year, $34.8 million extension in 2011. Without Kendrick's $8.48 million on the books, OKC could have afforded James Harden under the tax.\n\nSo my general statement still stands: amnestying wouldn\u2019t have changed our situation.", "Presti knew Harden and his agent wouldn\u2019t take less than a max deal. When they turned down the slightly less offer, he didn\u2019t have much time to work before word got out and reduced Harden\u2019s value. Other teams would have known OKC couldn\u2019t afford him (ownership would pay) and reduced their offers for him based on that. It was a quick move and waiting privately would have been better in the long run. But I don\u2019t fault Presti. The idea behind it was sound. If you keep Harden and he plays well (he likely would have) another team would have offered max and OKC couldn\u2019t match, because we had a cheap and relatively poor ownership group even a year after the trade. We only brought in more money because of the backlash from the trade. If Harden plays poorly, then you either trade him for diminished value or let him walk. \n\nYou\u2019re right I\u2019m sure Presti could have moved a few pieces and freed up cap space to sign Harden. But then you run into the issue of needing to fill out a roster with vet minimums and still running into the issue of going over the cap to sign everyone to have a full team.", "Bro you are the worst kind of fan. Chill the fuck out stop trying to get people to jump on your crazy train.. not everyone sees things your way", "Just looking at some of your comments in your history, you are severely dysfunctional.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trash, he still does a lot of things well, but he\u2019s probably overrated by the fanbase at this point.", "I get that. My point was their ripping Russ for not getting out of round 1 with an MVP candidate on his team. PG isn\u2019t that guy right now.", "Good information!\n\nYou\u2019re not taking into account that Presti did in fact offer James Harden a 4yr contract worth [**~$54 million**](https://mobile.twitter.com/wojespn/status/262391975347625985).\n\nThis was turned down and he was traded. He would go on to sign a **$60 million** contract with Houston.\n\nThat\u2019s a difference of ~$6 million over 4 years.\n\nIf the point you\u2019re making is about the Thunder not being able to afford Harden, then I can\u2019t fully agree with you there if they were clearly willing to go into the tax for him with their initial offer.\n\nMaybe Presti makes roster moves to get under that number ... we don\u2019t know. But amnestying Perkins would\u2019ve certainly been one of those moves."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

A simple cap on minutes per game is basic load management. No way that Russ, Adams, PG should ever be close to 40 minutes in a game unless we have guys fouling out of the game which we rarely do (if so, it's usually Russ, Adams, PG who are fouling out and because they're playing 40mpg).", "Because our team, whether we want to admit it or not, sucks.

It would have been better to do load management and play 100% line-up when we can than play 50-70% line-ups every night and lose anyway. Nobody is asking for a complete shutdown of guys, there are smart ways to do it. For example the game Adams missed against the Heat was one of the best games of the season. There are ways to plan it out based on the schedule and sports science.", "Facts. People are forgetting that we were legit wondering if we\u2019d miss the playoffs after the ASB.", "We also cant afford to run our players into the ground as we saw last year and Russ MVP year.\n\nLoad management might lose us a game or two but that just gets us a lower seed.

We should pick 14 games for the first 41 to sit either one, two, or all 3 to where each plays a total of 34/41. After that we should evaluate our remaining schedule and find the best games for them to sit another 7. If we can do this and go even 7-7 in the 14 games and make the playoffs still we'd be much better for it.", "Yeah because we lost a bunch of games PG would have been better off missing anyway. It's not as though playing him thru it benefited us much at all.", "There is zero chance Billy can coach our B squad to wins.", "Yup. He cant even change the lineups at all.

Yes they did not do as well after he came back, but they also were without some of their better players for large chunks of time and had given up on the season over the last couple months so I'm not sure I would put that all on LeBron for missing the playoffs when he missed 1/3 of the season and his team was down other top players.  Also, in his first run with Cleveland he pretty much always made the playoffs without another star. Hell, the 2017-2018 Cavs made the Finals without another star, the best talent other than him was Kevin Love who missed 23 regular season games and had a 15.5 PER in the playoffs. The year we made the playoffs with just Russ, he played 81 games.  If Westbrook missed 1/3 of that season, we would have really been struggling to make the playoffs, and only might have because the West wasn't as deep that year with the 8th seed just a .500 team.

There was no way he would resign with the Thunder unless they gave him a ton of money and Presti did not want to lose him for nothing.\n\n2) Since he is an expiring contract, he was the only contract that could be easily traded. There is a reason why he was the only trade after Westbrook & PG. The Thunder wanted to save money because no one wants to pay the luxury tax for a losing team. By trading Grant, the Thunder saved $39 million in salary and luxury tax.\n\n3) Many teams knew that Sam Presti was trying to blow the team up, so they have leverage against him. The team could not trade him for another contract because that would just add money back to the team. So a first round pick would be the only option and Denver\u2019s would be low enough to make the trade viable for them.\n\nI didn't know about the Westbrook thing, but hopefully this sums it up.", "How do they not develop players?

Some people watch just for Messi or Ronaldo to pop off and others watch for clean passes and good team goals.\n\nI think a good nba team needs to have a couple star players - however, what separates great teams from the rest is the supporting cast. You need bench players to step up when your stars are being shut down or just having an off game.

Dame will be remembered like you said, but more along the lines of one of those very good players that didn\u2019t do anything super noteworthy, while Russ will be remembered for obvious reasons.\n\nThese past two seasons, I would argue that Dame has played better than Russ. Russ for sure has had a better career but Dame at the time is simply in a better situation. It\u2019s not Russ\u2019s fault; he hasn\u2019t been able to play as efficiently as he was in past years because this is a team game and his team has just not been good enough. Russ is definitely more skilled, but Dame has been able to play better because of his situation. Nothing against Westbrook.\n\nI do disagree that Russ is closer to being able to win a ring than Dame, however, for the same reason I described above. The Trail Blazers are just a much better overall team than the Thunder, nothing against Russ.\n\nI love seeing arguments like yours for Russ. I\u2019m a huge Russ fan myself, he is one of my favorite non-Blazers... I hate seeing people hate on Russ for no reason (although I\u2019m fine with my team\u2019s fans bashing him a little right now because of this series. Friendly competition).

People who don\u2019t understand Russ\u2019s greatness might say things like that now, but in years his legacy will simply be that he was an all time great player who changed the way the game is played, and happened to never win a championship (assuming he doesn\u2019t). He made the finals with two all-time greats (one of whom wasn\u2019t really an all-time great AT THAT POINT), and lost to LeBron, considered by many to be THE greatest player of all time. Then Harden was traded, and they still did well in the playoffs, losing in 7 to the greatest team of all time. KD then left, leaving Russ as the only star on this team. He responded by winning an MVP and performing well in the playoffs, but losing to James Harden, the other all time great that played with Russ previously. In the two seasons since the Thunder really haven\u2019t been that good outside of him and Paul George (Steven Adams is also a very good role player). So the bad team explains his inefficiency in part, and also the lack of playoff success. But his legacy is already set, and he *does* still have time to add to it with some more amazing play in the coming years.", "I\u2019m not comparing championships or history.

Wishing you guys the best. -Laker fan", "this isn't the same situation though, KD was a free agent, it makes no sense for him to weaken his future team by asking for a trade right before his FA hit, thats like asking him to tank his potential so his old team could get more stuff and be better. PG is a free agent and literally cannot do what KD did.", "Still a bitch tho", "KD was a Thunder his entire tenure and never demanded a trade. Leaving during Free agency is the least snake thing to do. It's who he went to that made the narrative.", "Yeah because he totally had another choice", "Still sad to see him gone, but grateful with the way he carried himself. Good luck PG!", "Feels bad, but it's ok. If he wanted to stay on a mediocre team, he could've stayed in Indiana. He owes us nothing.", "Lets not forget that PG was staying with the Thunder until Kawhi called too. He may have been wanting some better moves by the organization but OKC was still his second choice, its not like he said \u201cget me away from here.\u201d", "Best of all, the conversation about requesting a trade was kept very private.

He wanted to play in his home town on a probably better team. Gave the thunder a ton of assets in return.", "Exactly. I'm not mad, just sad. But rn what's more important are our next steps. Is this a full rebuild or na?", "me 2", "This is so simply put, but it's soul-crushingly accurate", "I could have waited.  But I guess kawhi goes to the Lakers if this didn't happen", "It\u2019s a rebuild but we\u2019re not a franchise that tanks. Gallinari is a 3 pt shooting PF which is helpful and not easy to find- and SGA has a legitimate all star ceiling. We certainly won\u2019t contend  for the championship as the team currently stands but we will be fighting for playoff contention with the current squad we have and hopefully we can thrive with an underdog status.", "I don't agree with this attitude.

Westbrook had his chance too though. He should go all crazy about it. He deserves that.", "Well, while I don't know anything about what goes on in a players mind, PG seems like the type of dude that probably either called Russ or more likely met with Russ and told him what his plans were. He just seems lile that type of dude. Where KD told Russ that he was signing with OKC and then turned around and signed with GS. Like I said...I dont know this for any type of fact, it just seems like PG would be that type of dude.", "Naw fuck that. Snake George gonna get hurt again in clippers.", "It was no secret that PG ultimately wanted to play in SoCal (same with Leonard), he just needed the right opportunity. It sounds to me like ultimately no one wants to play with Westbrook for whatever reasons.", "[removed]", "Gotta wonder why nobody wants to play with Russ then", "If reports are accurate, he went straight to our front office and was honest. If he went public he could have tanked his value", "No it\u2019s not. It hurts us right now but he did what he always wanted, and made sure OKC was taken care of in the process.", "No dude. You're just being immature about it.", "He fuck the Lakers over twice.  I'm not going to blame Paul George, I blame the Lakers owner Jeanie Buss.  If only Jerry West was still alive.", "Full on rebuild. Trade everyone for picks and get cap space.", ">I could have waited.\n\nP is that you??", "Damn I didn\u2019t realize PG and Russ were THAT close", "Presti was trying to get PG and Russ to the Raptors. He totally knew what was going on. Masai wouldn't deal though and just lost absolutely everything for his franchise. \n\nThis isn't what I'm going to blame Presti for. I'm going to blame him for fucking Donovan fucking up repeatedly and keeping the job.", "[removed]", "Big this ^ he did right by us.", "We were making moves just a week ago with the expectation that the core of the team was Westbrook and George.  Then he suddenly comes up with this trade request so he can go play with Kawhi.  That's a snake move to me.", "ey p they said you gonna go to LA\n\n\u201chaha yeah...\u201d", "Don't you dock with your homies?", "Those fishing trips are somethin serious", "I feel like those talks with Toronto were just to drive the price up with LA", "Oh...I agree. I have NO clue why or how Donovan still has a job. I've said this a million times. I would almost rather have Scott Brooks back than Donovan(almost). The only reasoning I can think of is that our talent has carried us to the playoffs, so since we are a playoff team, we have a coach that can lead us to the playoffs. Presti is not dumb though. He HAS to know that Donovan is a shitty coach. It makes me wonder if Donovan has some sort of dirt on Presti or something and is holding it over his head in order to keep his job! Because, that is the most realistic thing I can think of as to why the dumbass still has a job", "Yeah the biggest mistake here is keeping Donovan I think that's what led to this", "We would never have won a championship with the team we had. He gave us a ton of picks and helped out the best way he could. It's not like we were up 3-1 on the warriors then he left to join them, giving us nothing in return.", "No way the team could be completed given the position Presti put us in via luxury tax. PG did us a favor. Now dump the low IQ Westbrook and lumberjack Adams, and build a new, young, vibrant, and exciting team. Get anew coach, and GM too. Do I make myself perfectly clear?", "Bro job bro job bro job hahahaha", "I heard Westbrook used to dunk on PG every night"], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

Nobody official said it's cancelled lol", "People are jumping to that conclusion because the best case scenario is the whole coronavirus issue is solved in like 9 months. This is a long term problem with a solution that basically requires fairly long term (week+) isolation or quarantine from everyone.\n\nNow i am no doctor and i could be wrong on this, but from what i understand is one of the things that makes the coronavirus more of an issue than other types of flu or illnesses, is that typically when you get one, your body fights it off and in that process your immune system creates preventions so you wont get it again or its very difficult for you to get it again. And again im not a doctor so don't quote me on this, but from what i understand either our bodies are not doing this or its taking a much longer time for it to happen. But even if thats not true, its spread way too much and pretty much all estimates have this as a year+ long situation.\n\nAll of that said im sure the NBA is still going to go through its typical operations. Which means the draft and free agency is going to be super interesting.\n\nBut as far as playing goes, putting players on the court, given everything we've seen and the preventative measures being taken by everyone, i think its more than safe to say that the season and POs are done.\n\nAnd not to get too political on this one but its definitely something we need to apply and consider moving forward when considering what we need to expect. The fact is we have a president with the IQ of a fucking rock who as he stated with the boat incident, is more concerned with the reporting of the numbers of infected people, than solving the problem. Add this to his destruction of a government funded medical group that specifically looked into illnesses transferred from animals to humans and allowed us to be steps ahead of these things previously (an invaluable organization with an amazing global track record), as well as his annual reduction of CDC funding, and a bunch of other things either caused directly by him or are a result of how our government has been functioning, this leaves us in a situation where we are months upon months behind the rest of the developed world on this one.", "I mostly jump to it because it just takes a subset of players raising a stink for the plan to kinda be ruined. Would the NBA legit say \"Nah we're moving on, if you don't want to get sick, don't play\"? I feel that would A. ruin the product depending on the player, and B. probably have the players' union object so as to not appear like it's throwing its players under the bus.\n\nI think it's possible to safely play. But will all the players buy in to the idea of even the \"safe way\" to play?", "Thunders have easily become one of my favorites in the NBA. I always loved rooting for the underdogs. I thought it was pretty shitty for PG to leave you like that and I'm glad you guys are doing as good as PG/Westbrook did as a duo even if though they left.", "That explains everything", "My reading of the situation was that currently, the outlook of the disease, and the long-term effect, is not known. There isn't good information on how much this disease has spread and if/when it becomes endemic, how bad it will be.\n\nHowever in a month we may have better view on what life with coronavirus in the US will be like, and then most operations will resume, initially without fans present.", "[deleted]", "I find it funny the Houston ships out CP3 cause they think he\u2019s washed out and get worse this season.\n\nAnd the Thunder picks him up and they\u2019re doing way better than last, I know it\u2019s not just CP3 but still great to see for the point god", "I think its more than reasonable to say the season and post season are done and not going to happen.  We're not seeing leagues and entire industries shut down for spring and summer because people don't have reasonable estimates and outlooks for this situation.\n\nI also think the \"without fans\" thing is a bit silly, just because it underestimates the precautions being taken. Even without fans, were still looking at 100+ people involved in a game and its airing, are they supposed to show up a day early, take a test, then isolate themselves in that arena to do this? No.", "Has the whole world stopped? No, simply unnecessary things like sports entertainment and other things that pack large amounts of people from around the globe in small venues. I mean... you do realize entire nations are on lock down and that we in America, are officially in a state of emergency right? Do you think these things happen on a whim? \n\nAs for China, official numbers say right above 80,000 cases and i think we all know that is a lie. But going off their official numbers 80k cases, 4k deaths, so 5% mortality rate. Don't conflate \"doomsday fear mongering\" with needing to take the necessary and proper precautions to try to reduce mortality rates. And to further expand on how silly the \"fear mongering\" claim is, i will explain what every one has already explained... most people will be fine with the coronavirus. But as with most dangerous flu variants, the elderly, new born's and toddlers and people with immune deficiencies are at risk.\n\nWhen we devise a vaccine, that's when we will start seeing the light of day, when we will start seeing these organizations prep for games, events, etc. again. The CDC and WHO have a vaccine at about a year away.\nHere is a NYT piece that is basically a quick FAQ.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html", "I actually don't think that testing protocol you described is that unreasonable. Many sports do something just as onerous for steroid testing.\n\nBut here's the deal, these sports executives realize that coronavirus isn't just going away. And even if it did, that it would be at least a few months before that happened. Baseball is going to shut down their entire season before it even begins? There's too much money at stake here for this to be anything other than a temporary measure.", "No. There is no single protocol in sports that comes close to testing over 100 people, then quarantining them for a day+ and its insane to even try to compare this to anything normally done. Even if this was reasonable, what makes it unreasonable is how limited our testing resources in America are for everyone. So suggesting that this should happen when we have over 100 million people who will most likely contract this and need to be tested, all to air some stupid basketball games, is, well its not exactly having your priorities straight. America can only test about 5,000 a day, we should not be wasting them because some people want to watch basketball.\nYes, what you say is not unreasonable, defines unreasonable IMO. Even if we could handle the extra testing load, quarantining people for 24-48 hours just to film a game, is very unreasonable. \n\n>Baseball is going to shut down their entire season before it even begins?\n\nHave you been paying attention to everything shutting down? MLB is already suspended indefinitely and that is not going to change until the situation in America as a whole, is changed. The situation in America wont change.... at best, being as kind as possible and presuming everything goes right (which we know it wont), for 9 months. Super duper unrealistic, best case scenario here. We come up with a vaccine today and start administering it by the thousands. It will still take 3 months or so before large public gatherings will be a thing.\n\nThis is not to cause panic of the situation because its not the zombie apocalypse, there is no reason to overreact here. But its still very serious and these measures being taken right now, will need to be taken for quite a while and from all the professionals ive heard, no one suggests otherwise. So strap in for the long haul, because you're probably not going to see basketball for another year.", "I was referring more specifically to the regularly mandated testing, not so much the quarantine. Even then, as the testing here becomes more efficient, I don't expect the quarantine window to be more than a few hours, let alone a day. I hear that the Utah Jazz got results within a few hours already. \n\nWith regard to your second point, I imagine that the testing would not be conducted by a public healthy entity, who would have to balance the greater good against the commercial concerns of a select entitled few, but a private lab that the league has contracted.\n\nI don't think this reality we are in, where testing is scarce and there is pervasive fear and uncertainty - is a long-term situation. There's very little precedent for a prolonged bout of frozen economic and commercial activity...not after 9/11, not during wars, etc..\n\nMaybe shutting down permanently is the right thing to do, as you say. But a lot of rich and influential sports team owners aren't going to be happy with that and would readily pursue any solution that avoids that. It's not really about people wanting to watch basketball, the impetus would be on the other side (the owners).", "> I was referring more specifically to the regularly mandated testing, not so much the quarantine.\n\nAnd what would be the point of mandated testing if people are simply going to leave and then risk picking up the illness and spreading it after being tested? In order for mandatory testing to function properly, you'd have to quarantine them, otherwise you're not doing anything. \n\n> I don't expect the quarantine window to be more than a few hours, let alone a day.\n\nTo test for the virus they have to swab your cheek, and then send it off to a lab. Best case, in countries way more prepared for this than we are, is it takes 24-48 hours. \n\nSo again lets go over what you're saying is reasonable. For one game, just one game of just basketball. And there's no reason why we could not extend this to other sports. You want 100+ people to get tested, quarantine themselves for 1-2 days, then play if no one tested positive because if someone did, its all a waste of time. And this is a reasonable use of our resources as a nation who can only process 5000 a day. All of this for one basketball game, just one. Want to go over say... 2 basketball games, 2 XFL and 2 baseball games in one day? \nYah, this defines completely absurd and unreasonable dude. I really hate to come at a fellow Thunder fan like this, but i have no idea what world you're living in. \n\n>but a private lab that the league has contracted.\n\nLuckily for us we live in an oligarchy and as a result there's only two labs in the country that do this type of testing. Remember that whole Elizabeth Holmes/Therenos thing? That's why people were throwing billions into it, because it would break that."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

We have a solid lineup if we have a shooter to assist Russ (PG if he stays, somebody more consistent hopefully if he doesn\u2019t), Adams, Roberson, and Grant would be a great addition to that lineup because he is so versatile and is only shown to get better. Because you want Dipo and Sabonis back is just more of a case to keep Grant. We\u2019ve given up so many young potential superstars in trades for things that don\u2019t work out as we planned. \n\nMelo is just old, that\u2019s all. He\u2019s not BAD. If he would play with the bench players, he may still be nearly as effective as he used to be. His extremely isolated style of basketball just doesn\u2019t get played anymore, so he ends up trying to shoot his signature contested turn around jumper but he can\u2019t compete anymore. He doesn\u2019t move as swiftly, he doesn\u2019t have the hops he used to, and the big men opponents put to guard that specific shot (because if he\u2019s not well contested- he will make it) are not mismatches in Melo\u2019s favor. Look at he and Lebron. Drafted the same year. Lebron adapted his game to young guns in the league.

I\u2019ll agree that he wasn\u2019t consistent for us this year, but I also don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right to just write him off after one season. He was definitely one of the more frustrated players in the league, and that could be due to a lot of factors (refs seemed to take the brunt of it, and the Jazz crowd absolutely got in his head). It might just prove to be too difficult to have two \u201calphas\u201d on the team, I literally have no idea. \n\nAll I want is a consistent shooter. Miracles do happen in the off season, so he may come back next year unable to miss. If not, I hope we end up with somebody that shows us the light. \u270a\ud83c\udffc", "PG has never been a consistent player. At moments he is unbelievably good. I think it would take a good coach to run a great offense to change that. Maybe his style doesn't mesh with Russ's but there were times this year where they looked like one of the best backcourts in the league. Chemistry isn't something that just happens. It takes a little time. LeBron didn't win his first championship when he left for Miami. ", "I wonder if it\u2019s because neither player is used to sharing the ball? If you look at Harden and CP3 they play well together.  Also KD and Curry are pretty good. I just think there is something not working, maybe we need more time with PG13 and Melo? ", "Those are a little different scenarios those. They were already well formed systems that they were plugging 1 new player into. This was a team trying to find a system with all new players basically and a fairly new coach. ", "I guess Carmelo may have been better suited to Houston.

Not an amazing day 1 player but did any of us really want that?\n\nThis guy fits our timeline perfectly.", "Whatever Adams eats he needs to eat and it\u2019s not even an option it needs to be built in his contract.", "Christ somebody feed this boy", "If I can\u2019t pronounce his name, then he\u2019s got to be good", "Ok, Nuggets fan here.  I made a compete scouting report about Poku back when I thought he would fall to Denver (he would have if the Thunder didn't trade up).  But I guess I'll leave that complete scouting report here just to let you know what a historic day this is for your franchise.    \n\nI don't think you guys understand. There is no risk here. Poku should be a top 3 pick in this draft because his skill set is unreal. Some draft models have his ceiling higher than AD. Let's go through it.\n\n1. Shooting: He's a 78% free throw shooter. Taking more than half of his shots from 3 he shoots 32%. Those are better shooting number than the Anthony Edwards the potential number one pick. Poku if he develops will be a knock down, best shooter in the league, like shooter.\n2. Rebounding: Poku averages 12.2 rebounds per36. People might not think that's relevant. But understand Porzingis averaged only 7.7 rebounds per36. Dragon bender only averaged 4.9 rebounds per36. It turns out getting rebounds against men professional basketball players is hard even if you are seven foot. But Poku does it effortlessly, meaning him being skinny doesn't effect his ability to be effective.\n3. Shot blocking: Poku averaged 2.8 blocks per36. That's crazy good. To put that number into perspective KP only averaged 1.7 blocks per36, Bender 1.5. Poku averaged a full block more per36 than Porzingis, one of the best shot blockers in the league. More over, Poku doesn't bite on pump fakes. Both KP and Bender averaged 4.4 and 3.9 fouls per36. Poku only averaged 2.4 fouls. Poku averaged more blocks than fouls. That speaks the world of a young 7 footer, he has control over his body.\n4. Steals: Guys, Seven footer don't average 2 steals per36. They just don't. They don't move fast enough, they don't have the reaction time for it. Even AD didn't average 2 steals per36 in college. AD only averaged 1.5 steals per36 in college. The fact the Poku is averaging 2.0 steal per36 is next level. Poku is a insane defensive play maker. Think Marisse Thybulle like defender as a 7 footer. That seems crazy unit you compare Poku to Thybulle at the same age. Thybulle when he was a 18 year old freshman in College averaged 1.9 steals per40. Now, Thybulle got significantly better, but that's the thing, so could Poku.\n5. PASSING: up to this point, I would still take poku in the top 5. Just with his defense, size, shooting, and rebounding. That's a top player, potentially better than KP, on par with AD like player. But this number breaks the models. This number is why he's projected better than AD. Poku averaged 4.8 assists per36. To put that number in context, Jokic the best passing big man of all time, averaged 3.6 assists per36 coming into the draft.... Now give Jokic some credit, he changed the game and was a trailblazer in letting bigs be the play maker. But still. Poku has Jokic like talent when it comes to passing the ball. As a nuggets fan I know how valuable Jokic like passing is.\n6. AGE: All this and he's the youngest player in this draft. He's younger than Giannis coming out. He's younger than Bender. That means his room to grow is next level. I'm baffled that we are even talking about drafting this guy at 22. Poku should go one in this draft, two at the lowest.\n\nPeople keep on calling Poku a boom or bust prospect. There is no bust potential here. He's too skilled. Boom or bust players are players like Dragon Bender who's skill set is hypothetical. Poku's skill set is real and developing. ALEKSEJ POKU\u0160EVSKI will be the best player in this draft.", "Master Poku!!", "I don\u2019t pay attention to any kind of amateur basketball except some March madness.\n\nCan someone tell me why I should be excited about this, and who does he resemble", "Wait so the Gallo trade to Mavs for 18 didn't happen because we got 17? So we still have a Gallo trade waiting to happen is that right\n\nHard to keep track anymore lol", "I\u2019m so excited we drafted him! We also got the rights for his Serbian buddy from The 76ers!!!", "We need feed him 5000 calories a day..", "I just watched a draft profile video of him, then compared the same to Kristaps draft profile, as it seems right to compare to two 7 foot skilled Euro kids are were/are both extremely skinny.\n\nThe biggest question for Kristaps then was is he too skinny/tough enough. No one doubted his skillset. The same question applies to Poku.\n\nLooking back you can kinda see that Kristaps actually played with quite a bit of toughness and had confidence in those euro leagues given how fragile he looked. He also played against men.\n\nPoku looks like he's only really played against kids, and he's way bigger than them all. This concerns me a little bit, as I think Kristaps was better prepared having played against guys bigger and stronger. However it's noted that Kristaps was 2 years older, and Poku can improve his physicality to the same level or more in that time.\n\nAlso, Poku is superior in playmaking, passing, handling and runs the floor alot more fluid than Kristaps did. Kristaps however is the far better defender, shooter and tended more inside-outside.\n\nPoku is perimeter orientated, so he doesn't need to be exceptionally strong in the paint however that reverses a bit on defense where he can be forced there.\n\nVery very interesting project.", " Im from Greece and big Olympiakos fan. This kid is special. He mjght turn out to be the best project.  Steal.

But what a talent he is. Pokusevski is a 7-foot, 200-pound guard who plays with the confidence of someone who has read all of the glowing internet scouting reports about him. It\u2019s going to take a long time for him to develop physically, and it\u2019s unclear what role makes sense for him at the NBA level.

Way weaker than Adriatic league (Joki\u0107), and Spanish league (Zinger), while Bender spent most of the time in 2nd Israeli division (weaker comp. than one Poku\u0161evski plays in)\n\nI think most interesting stat lines are those from U17 world cup, where Poku\u0161evski averaged something like 12/12/5/4bl/3stl in matches that mattered.

Not all do. Westbrook did, KD did not.\n\nNot saying anything was Durant\u2019s fault, but he made his bed when he walked to a rival after losing to said rival in the playoffs. Don\u2019t say they COULDN\u2019T have won. They just didn\u2019t win after a close series that had them neck and neck with one of the greatest teams of all times; but alas, Kevin Durant is softer than baby shit. Dude got his rings, I\u2019m sure he regrets nothing. While I have fond memories of him playing here, I\u2019ll never forgive him  for blowing up that team. If MJ jumped ship to the Pistons after the 1990 playoffs, Chicago doesn\u2019t build him a statue.\n\nWas PG drafted here? Did he spend more than a decade here? Did he win an MVP, battle through multiple playoff series, etc.? This is apples to oranges.\n\nRuss not walking out doesn\u2019t earn him a statue on his own, but does differentiate him from Durant, which is who you asked about. Russ is gonna end up in the hall of fame: 1 MVP, 8 time all-star, 8 all nba teams, 2 assist titles, 2 scoring titles.\n\nSince when has a statue been exclusively about rings? You know that out of all the titles in NBA history more than half have been won by like 5 franchises, right? Nobody else is allowed to have history?\n\nAlso, as far as existing statues go, John Stockton and Dominique Wilkins would like a word with you about qualifications. Neither won a ring, shit neither won an mvp.", "If you can't see the difference in John Stockton and Dominique Wilkins compared to Russell Westbrook then it boils down to that you just simply don't want to. \n\nJohn Stockton retired from the team who drafted him after playing *18 seasons* with them. On top of the mountain of accolades he racked up, he has 2 conference championships and he retired with 2 very significant NBA all-time records. \n\nLet's double check. Is playing for 18 years and never leaving the team that drafted you the same as playing for 11 years and then asking to leave instead of staying and losing? No. We can debate how significant the triple doubles record is but if we have to debate that it isn't as significant as being the all-time assist and steals leader then you're a lost cause.\n\nAs far as Wilkins goes, resume'-wise, I would agree. He normally wouldn't deserve one. But here is the difference. The Hawks franchise is 73 years old. Hopefully you can see the difference between a 73 year old franchise giving a statue to their best player in franchise history and a 13 year old franchise giving a statue to someone who arguably isn't the best player in franchise history.\n\nIf the Thunder we're 73 years old and somehow our franchise was embarrassed to such a level that nobody managed to be better than Westbrook in 60 years, then I would say why not? \n\nBut saying that Westbrook deserves a statue for being the best player for a franchise that just popped its first zit is utter ridiculousness. And if your whole basis for saying so is that there is one nonequivalent outlier (Wilkins) that exists then your reason is trash. It's pure participation trophy logic.", "Not denying Stockton\u2019s greatness, but the awards you mentioned are almost identical to Russ. Yeah he\u2019s got assist and steal records, and Russ has him almost doubled him up on rebounds and and ppg. Also throw in the trip/dub stuff and mvp and from a purely stats and accolades standpoint, pretty 50/50 right?\n\nThe Russ and OKC separation was mutual and inevitable. This isn\u2019t the Gulag, you don\u2019t have to stay at one place your entire career, but not burning bridges and leaving the organization in a better place certainly tilts the scales in your favor.\n\nI see your point about Wilkins, but just don\u2019t agree with it. Put it this way, let\u2019s say they did a statue of Russ tomorrow and then 7 years from now we win a title, does that invalidate or diminish all the accomplishments of previous players?\n\nSo Russ\u2019 resume is:\n\n1. Team success\n2. Personal statistical and award success\n3. Pretty universally loved among our fan base.\n\nFeel like that\u2019s pretty statuesque.", ">pretty 50/50 right?\n\nNo. Not at all. I'd argue that it's not even close. True Westbrook has double the rebounds and more points. But Stockton was an actual legit point guard, not whatever version of point guard that Westbrook is. Great that Westbrook gets all of those rebounds but that's not really a point guard's job.\n\nStockton was a dramatically better shooter than Westbrook from every area on the floor. He was a significantly better defender. His assist to turnover ratio is significantly better. In fact Westbrook is about to pass Stockton in career turnovers despite a shorter career so far by a handful of seasons. Stockton went deeper in than playoffs more than Westbrook. Stockton led the league in just assists more times than Westbrook led the league in any stat combined. Everything that a point guard is supposed to do on the floor for his team, Stockton did it dramatically better than Westbrook. So no, I don't agree. It's not even remotely close to 50/50.\n\n>The Russ and OKC separation was mutual and inevitable.\n\nIt was mutual and inevitable because Westbrook couldn't win. The team signed him to the biggest contract in the league, which provides a lot of motivation to stay by the way, and then recruited players that he ultimately couldn't win with. If Westbrook could get out of the first round, he might still be here. \n\n>but not burning bridges and leaving the organization in a better place certainly tilts the scales in your favor.\n\nWe disagree. I don't know why people here give him any credit for this. He stayed because he could get the biggest deal in the league and because he thought he was good enough to win without Durant. He was wrong, of course, and when he realized this he wanted out. Presti also wanted him out because he realized how bad that contract was. \n\nDurant played his contract out to win a title. And when his contract was up, he left because he didn't want to be stuck with Westbrook. Apparently he thinks that Curry, Green, and Thompson are better teammates than Westbrook. Judging by recent years events, Durant doesn't seem to be the only person to think this. People here give way too much credit to Westbrook for staying. He got to run his own team outside of Durant's shadow while being paid the highest salary in the league at the time. He had better reasons to stay than go, so he stayed. Durant had better reasons to leave than stay so he left. \n\n>So Russ\u2019 resume is:\n\n>Team success\n>Personal statistical and award success\n>Pretty universally loved among our fan base.\n>Feel like that\u2019s pretty statuesque.\n\nWe'll agree to disagree.

His impact was second only to Rudy Gobert that year and even then there wasn't nearly as much of a gap as people would say. In fact, you mention it yourself. OKC was middle of the pack for defense without Dre, while that team was an absolute defensive powerhouse before. That's even with Melo on the floor.\n\nIf you think Roberson wasn't a huge impact on the team, you underestimate the value of good defense. It's how AI made the Finals, it's how KG's Celtics won a ring, and it was a major factor in why the Warriors were so dominant even with Harrison Barnes.\n\nDre wasn't about to carry the team, but he was an important part of the foundation.

Such a shame.", "Oooh I didn\u2019t realize his contract was up,\nThanks for the info", "9 actually.

But I think Roberson probably isn\u2019t ready to call it quits just yet. He worked so hard to play again, I doubt he retires yet.

It's the overall Point differential that would matter. Also that Thunder team was living on forcing turnovers and getting easy buckets in transition.

He stopped doing his job, so we stopped paying him.  That's how it works when there's no medical reason for a work stoppage.  Why would he be bitter about that?

We waived him BECAUSE he agreed to give the money back.  Otherwise, we could have simply insisted that he play, since he was healthy.  If he refused, then he gets released without pay for refusing to fulfill his contractual obligations, and we're in the same situation, but it's messier.

I don't think that giving up in the face of adversity is something to be celebrated, or deserving of plaudits.

There are people with real challenges out there, and I frankly think this is quite ridiculous and makes light of them.  They don't get to say that they're depressed, and have the result be a 7 month vacation in Europe and a job transfer to their preferred market.  That's not how life tends to work.  It did for him though, and that's great, but I'm not gonna celebrate that.", "I think your the one who doesn\u2019t get it. The money is his to keep. He paid it back the org did not make him do that. How many players have you seen be released and they pay the money back Kyle singler was waived he didn\u2019t pay a penny of it back. Mitch mcgary didn\u2019t pay any of his money back even with all the off court issues he had. \nYou think he was upset playing in okc was his problem nothing else? \nNot the fact he has the mental strain of not seeing his family for a good 9 months of the year the Strains of practice almost every day traveling all across a country he is not from speaking a language that isn\u2019t his first. The fact that people attack him when he has an off night or misses a shot in a game. \nHis basketball ability fell off a cliff due to his issues and he lost a large amount of weight. If you don\u2019t think those are signs of someone struggling with their mental health then I\u2019m not sure what to think. People deal with things in their own way his was to leave and go home where he could recover and find his love for basketball again. I\u2019m not going to ask what you did to recover from your issues but you clearly did something that helped Alex did that by going back home where his support network is family and friends"], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

It's more of an indictment on durens inability to jump in traffic or quickly gather himself than it is praise for chets ability to guard an nba body. Obviously not every matchup will have a scoring centre so it's not a major concern but if he gets buried in the post by guys like Ayton, Sabonis, Sengun and to a lesser extent someone like JJJ then that's a big concern for his viability as an nba centre. \n\nAnd unlike mobley I really don't think he can be a 4. He's a lot slower laterally and I don't think he'll be able to recover from the perimeter to protect the paint against nba level athletes which massively affects his value as a rim protector which is his most important nba skill. If he can't protect the rim he doesn't really have much value as a player. Now I don't know whether he will be able to bulk up enough to make it a non issue. But this is his path to busting or not being a star level player in the nba. So it's important to bring it up.

Is that a detriment to Chet, no. If Chet isn\u2019t the other big on the floor they double Timme every time (the back door when he was wide open you literally mention) and they torch it. \nAlso say the roles were reversed and Chet had the hot hand in the second half.

They aren\u2019t in control of him falling. Wtf are you saying", "So weird", "The issue is duren has an nba ready body but not an nba ready skill set. If he had the crag and no how chet couldn't have recovered against him because he'd have been able to protect the ball with his off hand like Tim Duncan used to. I don't think it's easy to say chet clamped duren when Duren should have had another 3 easy layups but due to his lack of experience and craftiness he showed the ball and allowed chet to get it. Ofc it is impressive chet still managed to recover and accurately target the balls on those possessions. Which obviously means at the very minimum he should be able to provide some weak side protection if his foot speed is up to muster.\n\nBut in terms of that one on one defending I don't think it actually shows that much except that against a big body chet will be buried under the rim. Which is a big concern. Because if you can't guard the power wings as a rim protector you are going to have a hard time being successful in the nba. Guys like Kuminga, Zion, Giannis, Siakim etc. (and even more rim running bigs like Bam) could probably abuse his sleight frame and get a parade to the line and easy layups.", "I agree.

I think it can still work as I believe Shai is a willing passer learning under CP3. Dort also chucks plenty and has his share of ball handling a fair amount, Shai is only averaging high volume of shots recently since Dort was out. Best Shai is not a volume scorer but a hyper efficient iso scorer and elite catch and shooter who can playmake.\n\nIt's up to coaching to make it work between SGA, Ivey, and Giddey. My main concern is too much passing and ball handling but not enough shooting which is why I want Jabari.

There's a lot of details as to why that's the case, but it mostly boils down to the fact that *just good* teams whose ceiling is reaching the second round of the playoffs can only reach that next level by acquiring another superstar-level player either in the draft or in free agency, and we are not a free agent destination. \n\nNot all first round picks are equal -- we need as many **quality** bites of the apple that we can get, especially if Houston and LAC stay out of the lottery. So that means trade off older players who can help teams win now for their picks and take on \"bad\" contracts for picks. The thinking is we can either package those picks for an even better first round pick or very high quality players who fit SGA, Bazely, and Dort's development arc.\n\nI feel like I'm parroting a lot of folk wisdom from /r/nba and NBA twitter, but I think it explains the moves we've made since the end of last year. Once it was apparent how dominant the Lakers were in the Finals and how competitive the playoff race is going to be this year, it makes sense for a *just good* team like us to rebuild this year.\n\nAll of that said, last year's team was my favorite in all my years of being a fan. And some of my favorite qualities from last year are still around this year. Bazely is getting better every game this season. Dort is legitimately becoming a consistent offensive threat.

It'd be more like you turning down a $250k salary at a job you don't like to take an $80k somewhere you enjoy working.\n\nTo be clear, I'm incredibly doubtful he would turn it down, but he will finish his career with 10x that $48M whether he takes it this year or not.", "It\u2019s a lil different when someone already has hundreds of millions", "That's OK. I'd rather speak truth, rather than be a follower.", "This team could be in the play in next season.", "Did Rondo or Rubio ruin Cleveland\u2019s development? Did Pat Bev ruin Minnesota\u2019s development. Get outta here with that excuse. Russ loves the Thunder. He\u2019s invested here.", "I was thinking that Tre Mann's offensive development would benefit more with a playmaker like Russ, than playing with Theo Maledon or Ty Jerome, playing off the bench vs 2nd units. We'll still lose enough games because of the defense and turnovers lol, but on limited minutes, you still have Shai and Giddey immediately returning on the floor. Russ could chill out in OKC and concentrate on his family, his fashion line, and just being a veteran presence off the bench until he calls it quits. Just a similar role to a declining Favors who doesn't even need to see the floor most nights.\n\nBut yeah, wishful thinking. Really depends on our draft this offseason.", "Bro that is a pretty dumb take to be kind.\n\nDo you realize what they gave up for him?", "I don\u2019t think he will if it means he isn\u2019t getting paid that money. They even asked him about it in the press conference after the season ended and he said it\u2019s his decision. To me that implied he will exercise the player option.", "I said he wasnt a legend, that isnt discounting his whole career...\n\nClutch efficiency is not as relevant as total efficiency.", "[deleted]", "Again talk when you actually turn down $48 million. You never would but you can keep pretending. Some people on here will say anything no matter how idiotic it makes them sound \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642", "Easy to say that when no one would pay you $48 mil. The fact you think it has to do with greed shows how ignorant you are. That is the kind of money you can use to set your family up for generations. Taking care of your people is not greed it's smart, which apparently you aren't \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642", "BS.", "I doubt Presti lets them get to that point especially when the West is gonna get tougher next year and it\u2019s a great draft at the top.", "We don't want to be in the play in next year. If we're that mediocre the tank is coming back. If you accept it now it'll hurt less when it happens", "Russ hasn\u2019t had that sort of relationship with rookies like those guys have. Russ cares very little about development of rookies just look at how he was with Sabonis his rookie year with how he was absolutely terrified of Russ.", "Exactly. Tre Mann getting looks playing off Russ would be fun to watch off the bench", "Yeah do you realize last year they still weren't shit\n\nPoint being they're top heavy as shit before and after westbrook.\n\n\nUntil Anthony Davis can stay on the court they can't do shit anyway. \n\nIt's ruined both of the last 2 seasons", "Russ has plenty of money and outside ventures. I\u2019m pretty sure it wouldn\u2019t kill him to turn down 44 million to come play for a team that loves him, rather than staying in LA where they want him gone.", "OP is framing it like Russ is returning NOW, which for the lack of better term, is retarded. Russ may no longer be a superstar, but he's still a star and OKC isn't gonna take his 44M just so he'd be a six man.", "I have a Vanderbilt Ph.D. and am currently tenured as a professor. I agree with the kid who \"isn't smart.\"", "Right all these clowns willing to give up other people's money. No way in hell they would if someone actually offered it to them.", "I mean when most of our guys are playing (Shai, Giddey, Dort, Moose, Kenrich) specifically, we could definitely pull off being a lower playoff seed or play in", "Go watch Presti\u2019s exit interview for this season. He basically said that if our team is legit next year he isn\u2019t going to be developing young talent (tanking.) and if they aren\u2019t in a position to win they\u2019ll rank again.", "I mean if we\u2019re in the 7-10 range next season and the teams below us are too far back to catch, everyone here will have to accept we will be in the play in. It could literally go either way, depending on how we shake out next season. Land the right two guys at the lottery and we could be set. We just don\u2019t know yet.", "You don\u2019t think Russ is mature and would jive with these young players here?", "But only if Russ completely buys in. He might be buddies with Presti but Russ gotta respect Mark too, even as a younger coach. And Mark based on the interviews values the defensive identity he's trying to build with the young squad. I could see a possibility that Russ doesn't fit in especially since he's completely a role player in this scenario now, we have no idea how well he would take it.\n\nNot that Theo Maledon and Ty Jerome are defensive juggernauts either. It's just that Russ' ball-watching habits especially as he loses even more hustle at his age, that shit wouldn't fly with Mark. And it sets a bad example on the young guys.", "Sure but I'm not going to blame Davis for missing the playoffs entirely. That goes on what players were given up for Westbrook instead, and the piss poor season he had.", "Sorry what? $44m is $44m. This will almost definitely be his last year of being able to command a huge salary, he has to cash in while he can. While LA has been shit to him, he's still from there and isn't gonna turn down $44m while playing in his hometown. Unless some idiot offers him a 3+ year contract with more guaranteed money than $44m, he'll likely have 1 more year with LA (unless they can trade him).", "Thats the dumbest shit anyone could do. That's insane money. Let the lakers figure it out it's their problem not his", "My man, 44 milly is worth more than some people see in a lifetime. He\u2019s 100% getting that money, and at worst he and the lakers will agree he shouldn\u2019t play for them like John wall does with the rockets. It\u2019s gonna take a trade for him to suit up for a team other than the lakers next season", "Nah he should take the money, he can come back later", "He\u2019s absolutely taking the 48 million, are you insane?", "I think you got fan blinders on", "How the fuck do you know Russ\u2019 financial situation? By this logic, why would any vet star ever take a large contract? Why shouldn\u2019t LeBron just take pay cuts to let the Lakers get some big fish in free agency? This has to be one of the most absolutely idiotic comments I have ever seen.", "Lol okay.", "And I'm sure your family would love the fact you wouldn't want to set them up to be set and never have to struggle to get by \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642", "It may be hard to accept, but not everyone sees the world the way you do. Some people actually do not want to be rich. The thought of having that much money to myself makes me sick. I'd have to give it all away", "But what\u2019s the point? We lose in the play in or get swept in a series and then get terrible odds at a top pick in awesome top 5 draft or just end up at 15 or something. We still need a true superstar and Presti knows this as well and everything still points to being a bad team next year to play the lottery again for one of those top 5 guys. Presti will sit dude\u2019s again and probably way sooner like he said in his presser so I\u2019m really in doubt to this Play In idea. We\u2019re not making it over the Suns, Grizzlies, Clippers, Mavs, Wolves, Warriors, Nuggets anyway and teams like the Spurs, Lakers, Blazers, and even the Kings look like they can improve quite a bit so it seems idiotic to try to push right now.", "Yeah I took that as \u201cif we are way too good\u201d like we\u2019re 20-9 to start the season or something. If we\u2019re 19-18 and in that play in range he\u2019s gonna push that button at some point and bottom out.", "Given everything the front office has said, it seems we've got one more year of tanking unless something genuinely shocking happens. And as far as championship contenders, probably 5 years best case scenario", "Maturity is not my question with Russ it\u2019s just who he is personality wise. He\u2019s an \u201cabrasive\u201d personality who can be a bit too rough with guys and that\u2019s who he is and I loved it when he was here but we don\u2019t need that now.", "Yeah I don\u2019t see Russ coming here without having a clear conversation and understanding from Sam what his role will be. I have no worries. Sam is pretty straightforward from all accounts", "Can he negotiate with other teams before choosing whether to take the $44M? Or would he have to opt out first?", "It\u2019s insane money that 99% of people will never see and an amount that 99% humans ever to exist or that will exist will see.", "My family is already set. You don't need millions to be set. My dad makes a good amount of money, but he doesn't give me any. We all work for our own and then share. We are set because we have been fortunate enough to have gainful employment. Millions aren't the answer", "Again its easy to talk when you will never be in that situation. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642", "That\u2019s how you grow and improve. Getting that taste of the postseason. Look at what happened with teams like the Hawks, Grizzlies, Timberwolves, and Cavs. They made strides and improved.", "No he won\u2019t. If we\u2019re in any sort of spot to make postseason noise, they\u2019re not going to pull any levers. That\u2019s the exact reason Presti is doing all of this. He wants them to arrive.", "What Presti\u2019s words were (paraphrasing) is that if the team isn\u2019t in position to play games of consequence, they\u2019ll focus on development again. So if we get to All Star break and the Thunder is the 7-8 seed and would have to drop like 5 or 6 games to get to 11, would you really want to just tank and start sitting guys again? I get it if we are like 11th or 12th, but if we\u2019re overachieving next season, the team will run with it.", "Beverley and Rondo were abrasive personalities too and they haven\u2019t been hampering anyone.\n\nI think the team does need a little more of an edge. It\u2019s not like Russ is returning expecting to be the star of the team, but he can give them a physical and competitive spirit. He\u2019s a coach on the floor for them.", "His agent would know what the next step is for him to decline his option. Spoiler: He will opt in. It feels like the Lakers want to move him, but...he will get that bag.", "Pretty sure he can't negotiate with other teams due to league tampering rules, however those are broken every season (which is why you see multiple deals signed within seconds of free agency opening). He probably could see what teams are willing to pay, but can't imagine that 33 year old Russ is gonna get enough interest to decline the option.", "Yes, but more like 99.9%", "By that logic, your own assumption that you would take the money is equally invalid. Easy to say you'd take it when you will never be in that situation \ud83e\udd26", "Hawks are stuck in the mud, Grizzlies I like but I still have questions about their upside as a team, Timberwolves are a middling team to me who unless ANT really pops and becomes a superstar is not much of a threat, and the Cavs have already done a multi year rebuild and got Garland and Mobley and still need a bit more high end talent. Even if we get Chet or Jabari we still need to go another year to go back to the lotto and hope for good luck so we can really make that contender we dream of.", "An arrival is not getting beaten in the Play in as a 10 seed or getting swept as an 8 seed that\u2019s the definition of an \u201cappearance\u201d as Presti put it. If we\u2019re suddenly a 5 seed this year he\u2019ll let it roll but 7-10 is extremely doubtful especially when this draft class is an amazing one.", "I think we differ on what games of consequence means in this context. You're over here talking about bringing Russ in as a bench player for a championship run. Gotta modulate expectations hombre. We could've made the play in this year. But they didn't want to, so we didn't. They don't want to next year either, because low end play in is worthless until you're firmly on an upward trajectory that we just aren't near yet", "I am sure he will take the money. Nobody else is going to offer him that much at this point. My question is really more about the NBA rules than about Russ's situation.", "Thats the dumbest argument. Everyone is going to take it if they are in the spot. You guys just keep trying to argue to sound deep or some shit. That's life changing money for generations down the line, not taking it is just stupid. Its 8 months of your life being in a non ideal situation? To never have to worry aboutoney for you, your children, grandchildren etc? Oh no how will you ever get by? Oh wait that's how most people live every day, and they will never get the opportunity for something that life changing. But ya pass on it because \"I wouldn't even want it\" \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642", "I mean you don\u2019t know what happens. Look at New Orleans. They were in the play in, won through and got the 8 seed, Booker goes down, and now they\u2019re in a position to potentially upset the Suns. This will be a postseason they can build off of. \n\nDon\u2019t forget our first big run came after losing to the Lakers in six in the first round. \n\nDon\u2019t expect us to come into the playoffs and just be this juggernaut. We have to start somewhere.", "I think Russ is a win-win no matter what. He gets the respect and close his career deserves. We get another veteran to add to this super young team. Fans are elated to have Russ back. Either we overachieve with him or he doesn\u2019t do anything to mess with the tank. I think it\u2019s a win-win either way.", "Gotcha. Here is what I think I know. The end of each season goes like this, Lottery, Finals, Draft.  Each player has opt-in deadline dates stated within their contract but are due by August 1st.  This year, free agency negotiations start August 2nd and signings can be done after the 6th.  There is a moratorium period in between \"the end of the season\" and August 2nd when \"handshake\" deals can be agreed upon, but nothing is official until signed. \n\nRuss can shop before his opt-in deadline.", "I'm not the guy you're replying to, but I would like to chime in. \n\nI agree with both of you. What you are saying is absolutely correct. That sum of money is unfathomable, life changing, set for generation money. What the other commenter is saying too is true though to an extent. What is the personal cost of agreeing to that money? \n\nRuss made 44m this last year and has a net worth of 170m. For him, making 48m for another year is the equivalent of a 4k bonus for a person making 44k already. \n\nFrom there, it's all situational you know? Like I make 30k a year. if my current employer offered me 4k for 8 more months of labor, hell yeah I'd take it. I love that place! My last job though was a nightmare. They actually bumped me from 18/hr to 20/hr the last few months I was there, but the mental toll from working there was rough too. I finally ended up quitting on the spot and got the job I'm working now. At that time, that change took me from a 20/hr full time position, to a 10/hr part time position. I literally went from 41k annually to 12k annually at the drop of a hat because I needed out of there so bad (have since moved up and am making what I was). I gotta say, that change is what i needed. I still make ends meet, I'm happy, and I get to continue working in a field I love with half the stress. \n\nBut again, it's situational. We don't really know what Russ is going through. He may take a pay decrease. If i was getting booed at every game, (based off my actual past work experience) I'd probably walk away from it too lmao! Alternatively, he may be thinking of that money! Maybe he's got a plan for his 3 kids. Maybe he's investing it for future children. Regardless, he's already got 170m in assets and may not need that extra 4m. We just don't know. \n\nEither way, if I ever get 48m at the drop of a hat, literally a sudden cash increase of $47.9m dollars, I'm calling you two up because it sounds like all of us need it lol", "According to spotrac he has a career earnings of 288.5m as of this season, the 47m for next year while a big chunk of change represents 16% of his lifetime earnings. \n\nIt is disingenuous to say that 47m for him is a life changing amount of money. He already isn't going to have to worry about his children or his grandchildren, if he sets it up right the Westbrooks will be rich forever. \n\nDave Chappelle walked away from 50m in 2006, at time time that would be a fair comparison to what you are saying. A life changing amount of money in exchange for doing something he wasn't going to be happy with. And to my knowledge he stands by that decisions.", "Except it isn't. Definitely want Russ back but not until he's accepted that it's time for a supporting bench role. And I think that's still a couple years away. Especially with how much money he's owed next year. We don't even have the cap space to touch that."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

Ibaka also wasn't a stretch big around KD until 2016 and he shot below league average on minimal attempts\n\nOKC also had Abrines (38%), Oladipo (36%), Grant (38%), and added McDermott (36%) so the spacing isn't as bad as people make it seem.

Ibaka was also a threat from the midrange, it's not all black and white, it's not Moreyball.\n\nAbrines was the only real shooter in the whole roster. Dipo was decent but if a 36% shooter is the best one in the whole starting five, your spacing is dreadful. And you're not really coherent talking about the minimal attempts by Ibaka, but then listing Grant with 1.5 3PA per game that season. McDermott played about 1/4 of the games of the season.", "Agree to disagree", "what?", "it does when it's about fit around the franchise player and the spacing around KD was largely abysmal yet never failed to hit 50+ wins easily\n\nI'm saying if you're gonna list Ibaka, then Grant also belongs there while Grant also shot significantly better. yeah that's my point. spacing wasn't really an excuse when OKC got a great shooter in McDermott and still played the same way", "Exactly man im just expressing my opinion, not trying to fight anybody over KD, im just saying", "as much as I hate kd for leaving as he did, when healthy, he's the best player in the league.", "Its all good, i get it \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4fits just  the sub will forever have that on their minds (even me lol) so better to just leave it like that and not talk about it that much \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02", "People make decisions and sometimes they don\u2019t please everyone, KD thought he was doing the best thing for his career.

It\u2019s how he did it, not why.", "If KD did the same in any industry, people would still be pissed. I had a coworker who committed to a project, (months of specific training/cert, company truck, traveling expenses, equipment) only to leave the company dry and without a person to fulfill a huge project. The guy accepted a different position before the training even started, but decided to play the company. He was black-balled in the industry for a long time.\n\nIt\u2019s not where KD went, but how. He told the team he was staying, and knew he was out. Leaving for Golden State was not a good image, but understandable for a kid wanting a ring.", "yes the way the Thunder organization handled James Harden is way better.", "This is fair and I agree with 100% of what you said...but it\u2019s literally basketball and we are fans of a sport. It is a business and KD made a business/life decision to put himself in a better situation to win, after putting in a lot of blood sweat and tears in OKC. I just appreciate what we had with him, franchises go through centuries without being able to enjoy watching a player like that as part of your home team. I\u2019d rather not be salty about it and hope the best for someone than to fester on being a bitter emotionally hurt fan.", "If you think a player of KD\u2019s caliber was going to tell the Thunder org he\u2019s leaving without having a no trade clause you don\u2019t understand the business, that\u2019s just not how these things work.", "What did the org do to Harden that\u2019s analogous here? They just didn\u2019t sign him. \n\nNothing wrong with negotiations breaking down. If that was what happened with KD, then everything would be good.", "Sure, I agree and I do feel the same way. I think he chose to burn the bridge, instead of leaving on great terms. Honestly though, I think it was because he didn\u2019t want to have the hard conversation about leaving.", "No. I didn\u2019t say that.\n\n You don\u2019t say you\u2019re staying, then bounce. That\u2019s when you\u2019ve crossed the line. KD leaving was probably the right move for him. He should have just deflected. Went the the Hamptons telling his team that he hasn\u2019t made his mind yet. Then all would be good. It would have stung the org, but there would be nothing but respect for the time he had here. At least, there should have been.", "So KD gets backlash for leaving, but ownership can trade away loved players without fans batting an eye. Seems like a double standard.", "No...it\u2019s so we couldn\u2019t trade him.", "I\u2019m sure I\u2019m repeating myself, but I agree that players should have the right to leave as much as orgs can cut players. For instance, I was a huge Shaq and Penny fan as a kid. Shaq leaving hurt, but nobody was mad at him for it.\n\nOrgs can cut players and players can change contracts whenever they want, that\u2019s not the issue here.", "No it\u2019s wasn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t say he was staying until right before he went to the Hamptons. He deflected the whole year until his contract was up.", "That\u2019s why every player does in a contract year, what route did you expect him to take?", "I don\u2019t think you read my comment right. Yes, he was supposed to deflect until the contract ended. After the contract, he can\u2019t be traded, so there\u2019s no reason to say you\u2019re staying. Right?", "I guess my question is how could he of handled this in a way that would t of made you upset with him?", "If he didn\u2019t say he was going to stay before he went to the Hamptons.", "I\u2019m not all that bitter though. I still have his jersey, and am glad he was part of the team.", "Because you were upset with how he handled it and not exactly what he did, how should he of handled it?", "Don\u2019t say your going to stay, then blindside everyone by leaving.

But the athletes who are playing are people too and they can have their opinions on social issues, including going up to doing things like this right now. There\u2019s also a reason why race is the predominant issue at the moment. You ever heard of the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back? America has deep-rooted problems with racial inequality, which includes things like being less likely to get chosen for a job if you have a stereotypically black name. With regards to the fans, if they want their teams to play basketball games instead of attempting to bring about meaningful, positive change then I think the problem\u2019s not with the players, it\u2019s with the fans. By lumping in all black people with the looting and violence you\u2019re only exacerbating the problem, not solving it. At least 90-95% of protests are peaceful, probably closer to 97%. The reason everyone hears about the other 2-3% is because that\u2019s how media survives; off clickbait and half-truths. You\u2019re being a massive dick because you seem to value the storylines of this playoff run over the improvement of society as a whole. That\u2019s just being selfish and also unreasonable; we\u2019re going to have plenty of runs in the next decade, and I can almost guarantee that at least 2 make it to at least the second round if not further. Your \u201cbigger picture\u201d reinforces this image; you\u2019ve stereotyped all black athletes, you\u2019ve basically said that one playoff run is more important than improving the lives of hundreds of millions of people who\u2019ve lived their lives being denied the same treatment as others because of their skin colour, you\u2019re acting like more people voting to determine the direction of the US is some sort of curse.

You could use my posts in this thread as a perfect example of that, but keep in mind that the pendulum swings both ways. \n\nJust because you agree/disagree doesn\u2019t make you or me right/wrong. The \u2018bigger picture\u2019 is a diverse, multi-racial community where there is peace and a color blind law enforcement and legal system, right?\n\nI am certainly all for that! I\u2019d imagine every single human with a conscious and soul agrees - universally across the board - police should be there to \u2018serve and protect\u2019 and government policies and the legal system should be color blind and apply to everyone equally, right? \n\nYou talk about American having deep-rooted racial problems in the past, yet my entire life I\u2019ve experienced nothing but Top 40 music/entertainment being predominately hip hop/rap/club music most heavily influenced by black Americans, minority Hollywood/TV superstars, black characters that inspired me, multi-million dollar predominately black athletes that accomplish tremendous feats in pro sports, black writers and influencers becoming key political figures, and just a general observation of wide, diverse success. \n\nIn history, I learned about how [JFK](https://youtu.be/1wXf08-42x4) and [MLK](https://youtu.be/smEqnnklfYs) were both killed by the corrupt, racist, manipulative \u2018deep state\u2019.

Grant would have been the missing piece last year, as we desperately needed a small ball defensive competent 5 that wasn't a rookie.  Even if, for whatever reason, it was OKC and Houston in the first round, Grant would have been the difference, because he could go out and cover Jeff Green at the 3 point line in ways Adams could not.", "When did he say that?", "No one expected the thunder to be that good last season. He was definitely pissed that the franchise he was loyal to had traded him. Cut the kid some slack", "Baze????", "Felt like the Grant trade was a calculated tank move. And ultimately that's all Jerami was saying by basically giving people a heads up that he's out of there. I wouldnt call that burning a bridge.\n\nBut, it's nice to know that the additional FRP we got for Grant allowed us to confidently move around for our targeted players in Poku and Theo.

Think about it, even with the greatest player of this generation, who hasn't missed the Finals in almost over a decade, they couldn't even make it to the playoffs. That's fuckin laughable, and the Lakers should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nAdd on to that, the fact that their POBO turned out to be a lazy bum, who treated this position like another side gig. And takes pride in the fact that he was hardly there, only to waste another prime year of Lebron and effectively fuck over the franchise going into one of the most important offseasons in a long while.\n\nOn top of that, they just fired their young head coach - who admittedly wasn't doing the best job - for possibly Jason Kidd or Tyrone Lue.\n\nAnd if we're going further, the fact that Linda Rambis has any reputable/influential position in the organization is baffling; that Kurt Rambis who floundered with the Knicks has an actual influential position with the org, shows Jeanie hasn't learned that you can't just dole out positions to people you know.\n\nAlso, Jeanie told Jerry West to get bent. I don't care about the Presti moves or losing Harden or KD. Telling Jerry West to get bent after he brought your organization multiple championships as a GM, has an amazing history as a Laker player, and then built the best team of this era is a big fuckin mistake.", "You are FAR from the most hated team in the NBA.

The surrounding inland areas (eastern WA/OR, Idaho, etc.) root for the Seattle teams but have a distinct identity culturally. The inland NW doesn't have much of it's own (think Gonzaga), and there's a ton of resentment in general. \n\nThe Sonics' departure was because of some ownership shenanigans, so that didn't help either. I think that most people I interact with understand that the Sonics will get a team at some point. And although it isn't anyone's fault except ownership's, it's easy to look at the Thunder and their star power over the last 10 years and be resentful", "It was beyond shady tactics. Clay Bennett outright lied to the city of Seattle saying the team wouldn't be moved, but leaked emails showed that the ownership group's intention from the beginning was to relocate immediately, and they took deliberate actions to ensure a new arena wouldn't be built.\n\nY'all need to watch the documentary Sonicsgate to understand how your ownership group stole a storied franchise from Seattle, not to mention KD and Russ.

It was as clean as it got. He didn't fuck your locker room up with trade talk. He wasn't obligated to stay at OKC. He played through his entire contract. The guy fulfilled his contract I don't see how anybody could be that mad at him. Sad that he left sure but complaining he fucked you? He did no such thing. He left in free agency.", "I feel like the Jazz got so fortunate with their Donovan Mitchell pick...Hayward left them with nothing and they were still really competitive", "Unfortunately I think that's because Russ recognized he wasn't as good as KD, so he deferred.

What do you expect to happen after that?", "Dude, get the fuck over it. OKC is far from the most hated, but Russ's recent anti-media , premature celebration, brick after brick antics have put you all under the gun. I mean, how is that not obvious?

Youre overreacting by saying people never give us credit when we win and ONLY hate on us when we lose. Its not like that. Be objective. Loads of people were really impressed whenever we played them. I remember thousands of comments saying \"shit that okc defense is the real fucking deal, they gonna give the warriors hell\". Are the majority of comments against us now? Yes. But the 3rd seed just knocked out the 6th seed. Why should they be surprised? Because they had high expectations of us? because they saw how we played when we played their team at the start or the year. Obviously none of them watched us post ASB.", "Yeah, because we matched against the Blazers instead of the Nuggets or Rockets, and the Blazers had just lost their starting center. We were happy because it looked like we had a good chance to get past the first round, but then our players shat the bed. \n\nAnd the OKC players didn't talk any more shit than the Blazers did. Dame started that back and forth shit in game 3.", "I mean u can\u2019t call them trash bc they were literally decimated by injuries this year... I\u2019d put them in the same category as the Thunder as mediocre but I wouldn\u2019t call them trash, I believe Thunder are still more talented but you guys have similar problems as the Lakers, and that\u2019s shooting. Tbh I don\u2019t think either team is mediocre, even good, but the way the NBA is now is that you need shooting regardless of talent sadly", "Who said he didnt?

Lol ok man u can have it.. \"fuck the celtics\"", "But you agree with the hate we get? So what is there to disagree about?", "Because it happened yesterday", "im saying you should stop crying, it gets much worse, lol", "I agree we're getting hated on. I disagree that we don't get credit when we win. Stop being all 'woe is me' your victim mentality is painful. We lost because we were worse than portland and dame was better than russ. Pretty much a microcosm of our season. We lost as the 6th seed vs the 3rd seed. And we can go tooth and nail over why that is but basically the reason we were 6th is because we are the 6th best team in the West and they were the 3rd", "Did the pacers have a dedicated thread where the fans r taking shots or shitting on them? What about the pistons? Also bleacher report just put out a article about russ.. it's the 3rd in one day lol", "Cool story bro", "Victim mentality? Your a funny guy... i dont think anyone but u took it as me tryna play the victim, lol a funny guy u are", "In all fairness...no one actually expected the Pistons or Pacers to have a chance. \n\nYou also have to put into perspective the individual. Russ is a superstar that has a chip on his shoulder. \n\nI feel bad for Russ right now but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s really getting treatment that anyone else wouldn\u2019t get.\n\nIf Steph, Durant, Harden, Kyrie, etc. shot like Russ did and their team got eliminated you would see the same exact thing for them. \n\nAlso, last night the team was shooting 60%+ and Russ still felt the need to attempt his shots when he was shooting 35%.

If your poor decision making costs your team a chance to win, you deserve to be called out for it.

Let KD leave for literally nothing and this isnt just some player this is the 2nd best player in the league for like 5 years only behind lebron james. KD goes on to say in his burner that OKC FO and their ability to not get players to help himself and WB. this is documented when we tried to get pau gasol and he wanted no business living in OKC. Yes many players looked at OKC as a no go zone. Culture starts with leadership WB and  his hardwork ethics spread to all players around him and created that identity. Dennis schroder before coming to OKC was in atlanta known to be lazy and unwilling, got into heaps trouble to the point where he might of gotten kicked off the nba. He comes to OKC excited to play along WB. PG got traded to OKC knowing WB was there. Oladipo said without WB he wouldnt know what hardworks means. WB wasnt able to get OKC a ring but you know damn well he created a legacy in OKC and \"3 1st round exits\" doesnt mean he did not give the city an exciting destination for basketball.", "Just mad that people in this fan base think like you that\u2019s all", "[removed]", "I think that\u2019s a skewed view of OKC. Chris Paul came here to start his career and he said he loved it. That was before the OKC Thunder was here. His triple dub season was great, but it didn\u2019t amount to anything other than an impressive stat. Okc was a destination for celebrities to watch games way back when we had both KD and Russ. \n\nI remember pau saying that, but a lot of NBA players wouldn\u2019t want to go to a place like Milwaukee, etc., due to its climate or people, but they\u2019re a great team rn. Schroeder wanted to come play with Russ and PG, but oladipo was coming here under the impression he would play with KD too. \n\nRuss gave everything he had, but sometimes I think people, especially in Oklahoma (look at OSU football fans) are willing to accept consistent decency instead of greatness. You can only take so many decent seasons, and playoff exits, before you start to wonder what happened and why aren\u2019t we advancing. Blame lack of shooters, blame billy, blame whoever, but Russ has a part in all of that too. A lot of players, the majority even, would love to play with Russ, but I also don\u2019t see anyone saying man he was a great leader, he made people better, etc. He \u201cmade people better\u201d in a quest to promote himself. Look at Chris Paul this season. Having detailed discussions with reporters, mentoring his young teammates, and overall being the type of leader WB never was. I recall Westbrook not wanting to do anything with Sabonis. Look at him now, he\u2019s killing it for the pacers. Same with Oladipo when he was playing. \n\nYou don\u2019t see anyone this season going \u201caw man we\u2019re carrying on Russ\u2019 legacy and how he taught us to play. No, they\u2019re playing *team* basketball, have accountable leadership, and are having fun. Russ could never have enabled that", "It seems like there are a great deal of people that feel the opposite way, from what I can tell at least", "Are you fucking 12? Shouldn't you be in school or something? Is English your first language and can you read? Because I'm questioning all of that.\n\nNobody is comparing Jordan to Westbrook, dummy. The point is that even the arguable best scorer in history knew when the shot wasn't his to take. Why is that such a hard lesson for Westbrook to learn? He should've learned it by now.\n\nAs far as Harden's shooting performance, if he was taking wild 3s and bricking them all night, we could talk about it. Likewise, if Westbrook was wide open and just missed, we wouldn't have anything to talk about. \n\nBut since Westbrook's only 3 attempt of the night was quite possibly the worst shot that anybody took over the entire game for both teams, we're having this conversation. Superstars and team leaders are responsible for making the right decisions to help their team win. Yet, with the game on the line, Westbrook seemingly can't be trusted to make the right decision. Explain that?", "I cant believe Im even bothering to respond to this but... His triple double season led to him breaking a record that no one thought would ever be topped. And an MVP award... Winning MVP makes you great, not 'decent'. \n\n\nYou don't see anyone saying man he was a great leader? You really must not pay attention then. There is no past team mate who is filled with anything other than praise for Russ except Reggie Jackson. Russ was a superb leader, and is even playing like the only guy who gives a shit on this current Rockets team.\n\n\nYou recall Westbrook not wanting to do anything with Sabonis? What does that even mean? Source? Oladipo directly credited Russ for how much better he got\n\n\nThe team is playing a better style and its more enjoyable to watch this year, which we wouldnt have had with Russ as he is a high usage player. The OKC teams always seemed to have a lot of fun when RUss was here too... not sure why you said that\n\n\n\nYou are just really off on basically every comment you made IMO. CP3 is great, but lets not just ignore everything good that russ did here (including being the best player on the team in an NBA finals)", "Obviously yeah, most people aren\u2019t fools", "Yet here you are, responding! \n\nMVP means you were voted as the best player during a season. Russ was the best player on a pretty bad team. Does that make you great, or lucky? D-Rose is an mvp, but I\u2019d argue he was only great for a little while. \n\nCan you give me an example of how Russ was a great leader? He flamed other players on court and acted like he was actually playing defense. He never gave a single interview that wasn\u2019t contentious and arrogant. His response after losing in the playoffs was simply \u201cI\u2019ll fix it,\u201d or something along those lines. Being gruff doesn\u2019t make you a leader. \n\nI recall Russ not liking sabonis on the team and not remembering his name or something. I can\u2019t find a source, so maybe you\u2019ll just have to take my word, just like I may have to take your word that he\u2019s a great leader, despite having no concrete evidence. \n\nWhat makes people like you want to defend him if you admit the team is playing a better style that wouldn\u2019t have been possible with him here? We can say he was the best player on the finals team, but what does that count for? AI was the best on the 76ers in the finals, and what did he get for it? Morning. \n\nI don\u2019t want to ignore the things Russ did while he was in okc. I can admit he was a good player and did what he could on some bad teams. But I also can\u2019t understand this subs constant glorifying of a player who isn\u2019t even here anymore. There\u2019s no way to move forward if you\u2019re stuck on the past. Imo people may even be glorifying a past that is worse than what the future holds.", "Damn you called me a fool, grr.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibfJKT42UbU\n\n\nYeah and go and ask any 76ers fan how they feel about AI... What is even your point there?\n\n\nthere you go.This is just one obvious example of probably 20 videos I could find you. That's leading. Also his recent comments in Houston that he doesnt want anyone hanging their head and that he'll pick them up. There are so many examples of him being a great leader.\n\n\nI have seen every Thunder game ever and visit this sub basically every day and have literally never heard of him not liking Sabonis. In fact I remember them having a chat and laughing after Sabonis was on the Pacers after an OKC Pacers game. Russ usually doesnt talk to the other team post game, so he obviously liked the guy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8IDUCbh6g0. Certainly doesnt look like Sabonis has a problem with Russ\n\n\n\nI love the current team, but that doesnt mean you have to even mention Russ. Its just disrespectful for a guy to give everything to a team and then as soon as he's traded you just forget about them. We're playing better team ball than we have ever played this year, but its not going to amount to anything other than a first round exit. \n\n\n\nThere is absolutely no guarantee that the past is worse than what the future holds... Russ was here for a finals appearance, got an MVP and is a lock for the Hall of Fame. If we get a player that surpasses what he was able to do here, then great. But I doubt we will be able to get anyone of his calibre on the team again. \n\n\nAlso no... winning MVP isnt lucky. D Rose was only great for a little while because of injuries man...", "Morning was a typo on my end. I meant nothing. You don\u2019t think AI doesn\u2019t wish he could\u2019ve had a ring? Most people would trade that adoration in for it. The point is have a singularly great finals appearance and being the best on your team means nothing. Lebron didn\u2019t care about when he got to the finals with the Cavs and got spanked by the Spurs I\u2019d imagine. \n\nMaybe I just misremembered his beef with sabonis. I can admit that. The point about Russ is not forgetting him, but the danger of holding onto the nostalgia goggles of the past that prevent you from seeing how the future can be, or even how good the present is. \n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee the past is better either. I\u2019m sure some people can never let go of it and think ah yes, if only it could be this way again. But fortunes can change, and the future can hold things that were impossible in the past/just didn\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t recall saying winning mvp is based on luck. Just that it doesn\u2019t matter I\u2019d imagine to all the Steve nashes, etc who haven\u2019t won a championship. Now with 2 mvps though, you can argue that makes you a singularly great player. \n\nRuss was an mvp, but he had a negative plus minus this year for a bit on the rockets. Is that greatness? \n\nI know some people will defend him to the end, and lord knows I did for the longest time. But I eventually changed my mind when I realized his attitude about losing in the playoffs, refusing to follow coaching schemes, putting fashion and such above winning and playing team ball, is what\u2019s holding him back. JJ recently said he thinks some players are more concerned with their pregame fits than winning. Russ immediately came to mind.  \n\nDoes a leader sit away from their team (rockets at okc, did you watch that one?) and refuse to be coached when your team is getting destroyed? Does he blame everyone else outwardly and go sit in time out like that? Or does he rally the troops as best he can, then go back to the locker room post game and air his grievances there? Russ won\u2019t ever do that, because he can\u2019t. And I\u2019ll never really be convinced until he proves otherwise"], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

I definitely don't want him traded, it's a business and would understand it tho. \n\nBeing an NBA GM isn't easy.. Think about how hard it must have been to trade Ibaka and Kanter.

He was always an alright coach and this season proves that he can make huge system changes, but in terms of adjustments; knowing which lineups to play; knowing what to do in specific opponents; I think he's a bit lacking. He insisted on Semaj in 2017 when he can absolutely run Oladipo as backup PG. Consistently trapped Rubio in 2018 even though he's not a shooting threat. He also played Melo way too much that series. 2019 didn't trap Dame AT ALL and let him get hot. And playing Adams too much this year.

I fully trust Presti to find a coach that's main goal will be to completely coach fundamentals - X's and O's. The Thunder are going to need it.

Due to fans not being able to go to games, we will be forced to cut salary/find young marketable players. In normal circumstances this would seem normal, but it\u2019s worrying me because it almost sounds like Presti is being pushed by investors.

There\u2019s never been any type of system I\u2019ve become so accustomed to isolation plays at the end of games I\u2019m shocked when an actual play is ran to get a bucket.. people like to point fingers at different things when we talk about why in the last 10 years with all the star players we\u2019ve had, future HOF\u2019ers we had, why does this team have 0 chips in the last 10 years? Some say injuries, some say westbrook, some say Durant, I say shitty ass coaching, I\u2019ve never seen a team win a championship playing fucking iso ball, our team needs an actual fucking coach for ONCE, presti is incredible @ drafting and developing players but he is god awful at picking a competent coach.", "Mama there goes that fan", "Surely Presti isn't that dumb.", "Or kidd, or lue.\n\nI'd be okay with Atkinson.", "How about P.J.

But perhaps there's value in the \"service industry\". Trade away an injured superstar to Presti, where he can take a full year of max pay not grinding away on a playoff-bound team.\n\nOf course any deal can sour if the price is too high, but is theoretically win-win-win. Presti gets more assets as the cost of doing business, superstar gets their pay while in a less intensive environment where their recovery is not at odds with team goals, the original team gets other players that can produce now without blowing up their health and they're left with a lot of salary sitting on the bench through the playoffs.\n\nOf course this only works if you have serviceable win-now players on your roster, but Presti always seems to have a couple, and now we have Kemba to flip next year. One-year max Kemba getting traded away won't get 5 firsts like full-contract trades like Russ and PG but with a player like Kemba I think that's a positive. He's great but 4 years of the max might turn many teams off of the idea.", "He was very slow to start the year coming back from surgery. It wasn\u2019t until probably March that he was playing good basketball, and still had to sit back to backs throughout the whole year. He had some of the worst shooting of his career during that first stretch of 15-20 games.\n\nHope he can stay healthy and looks good for you guys, a full off-season of rest should be good for him, just a real big question mark how his knee holds up going forward.

The problem is he\u2019s getting paid like a superstar and he\u2019s has some injuries. I think he will have a good season. Last year (only 43 games) was one of his best in terms of efficiency. Assuming he\u2019s healthy he has a lot left in the tank imo, so there should be a good opportunity to flip him for more assets.", "Yeah I do and it\u2019s obvious because he\u2019s on a shit team so it\u2019s irrelevant how bad the contract is. The rockets know it\u2019s bad and are tanking so it effects them pretty much none. Kemba having a contract that bad on a team not tanking restricts them from doing a lot of things.

The supporting cast around him was changing so frequently and he didn\u2019t play the last part of the season, so he didn\u2019t shine as much as he could have. But I think Shai is already \u201cthat guy,\u201d and we just need another 1-2 around him.\n\nAnd I agree drafts are not a sure thing, but I doubt Presti\u2019s plan is to pick a bunch in the 15-20 range and hope one pans out. We\u2019ll hopefully have a high lottery pick this year, and we have the capital to move up a bit too.

But he was 100% considered washed, a negative asset (one of the worst in the NBA even) before his year in OKC\n\nAnd yeah no one was fleeced. I get the move for the Celtics. I'll take the pick though. No franchise in Oklahoma will ever be a destination for free agents. Our cap space is absolutely 100% expendable for more swings at building through the draft (pretty much the only way the Thunder can build)", "Yeah, I hadn\u2019t totally given up on him, but understand this was more about money. By getting off his contract and with Horford\u2019s not being fully guaranteed, I think our FO is okay with taking a step back next year to create cap for 2022 and try to bring in a third star with Tatum and Brown, since in a few years I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be hearing those talks of \u201cTatum and/or Brown thinking about leaving Boston\u201d if they haven\u2019t won or even reached the finals in 5 or 6 years there and getting near the end of their contracts. I think Celtics management understands we have to go after a 3rd star whether that\u2019s someone like Beal, LaVine or someone of that caliber where we can compete with Brooklyn before Tatum wants to walk and we have to blow it up.\n\nI love Kemba but at $37M and him being a negative trade asset right now there was just no path to do that potential big deal down the road without the cap flexibility."], "CommentLinkTitles": []}

Melo could have been a diva, he could have demanded more attention and more focus on the offensive end but he hasn\u2019t. He has quietly turned his stats around this year and is giving us solid minutes while shooting near career high % from 3 pt range and giving Adams solid help on the glass. \n\nPG and Russ tend to dominate the news for OKC and who can blame anyone, but let\u2019s not forget that we have a historic all time great scorer in our small city balling out for us. If a team wants to sleep on Melo, let them because he can still give you 40 on any given night. Love our team, love the energy and love the hooded one. ", "Three biggest concerns coming into the season with Melo were his ball stopping, defense and rebounding and I think he's exceeded expectations in all three over the past two months. Kudos to Billy D for sticking with him in the starting lineup when all the talking heads were calling for him to come off the bench. ", "Melo has sacrificed  his entire approach this year. This was something I was concerned with when he arrived. If you watched earlier in the season.. he was one of the first members of the squad to embrace team first basketball. He was constantly making the extra pass.. rebounding the basketball and playing defense. His shots just weren\u2019t falling. Now his shots are falling and he\u2019s still playing that brand of basketball. He is changed as a player for our squad and it\u2019s doing wonders ", "Melo has always been a team player.  The problem was most coaches abused his elite ISO abilities e.g. Nuggets and Knicks and then put the blame on Melo when things didn't go well.   As a result, Melo gained the reputation of being a selfish ball hogging team cancer incapable of playing team basketball.  How do I know this?  Look at the difference in the way he played on team USA surrounded by all stars in their prime vs. the likes of JR Smith and a PG in Chauncy Billips and Allen Iverson leaving their primes.  \n\nThis is the first time in Melo's career that he is playing with all stars in their prime and he has embraced his role.  Imagine a prime Melo with this team?  Absolutely terrifying.  ", "\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffdMELO\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd", "StayMe7o y'all!! Let them sleep on us while we balling every game!

It was in large part because all of the former Nuggets CHOOSING to be part of the Knicks. JR Smith and Kenyon would follow this guy to the end of the earth. Sidenote, JR Smiths entire career has been along side a member of the bananna boat, is he an honorable mention?", "I love Melo, he seems like a good dude and I know why knicks fans liked him. So underratted, hope he gets a ring here.", "Me7o!!! \n\nGlad he adjusted, having someone like Melo as the 3rd option is a luxury.", "Melo has been amazing for us.  He's our 3rd option this year and he's averaging more points than oladipo our 2nd option last year and shooting the same % from 3 that oladipo did.    And he can create for himself which oladipo couldn't do while in okc.", "I was getting a bit frustrated at first. Now, however, I have an abundance of love and appreciation for him and am happy when i see him out in our jersey", "Hello Jello Heso Me7o. ", "Melo is big part of why Im a Thunder fan. I was born in Dallas, all of my family are hardcore Mavs fans. The 03-04 season was when I really started paying attention to the NBA and watching games on my own. Obviously my family tried to persuade me to root for the Mavs but for Christmas my brother had bought me a pair of Melo 1.5s, my 1st pair of J's, since then I became a Melo fan. I would catch Nuggets games every chance I got, my 1st NBA game was a Mavs vs Nuggets game. We moved to OKC the 1st year the Hornets were here and of course the 1st Hornets game I went to was against the Nugs, even my 1st Thunder game was against the Nugs. Over the course of the 08 season my fandom naturally crossed over to the Thunder(mainly because KD went to Texas) but I always paid attention to what Melo was doing. Yall cant even imagine how hyped I was when I found out we got Melo. Its crazy to see it come full circle with him being on my favorite team now, you can tell he really likes it here and to see the sacrifice he makes pay off really makes me happy. I hope he retires with us. \n\nTl;dr: Being a Melo stan kept me from being a Mavs fan.\n", "This aged poorly.", "Does he usually loudly turn around? That\u2019s gotta be obnoxious.", "1.  He will be even more valuable in the playoffs. 2. Alot of the complaints about Melo had more to do with the teams he was on.  Give him folk to pass to and a reason to play defense, he will try to do both.  Run terrible plays, give him the ball with 8 seconds on the clock, and complain he didn't pass to a guy who shouldn't be in the league anyway are really not good complaints.", "So underrated!

It was way past time for him to leave but he didn't deserve as much blame as some NY fans gave him for our failures", "I myself am very impressed with melo as an individual, never thought it would be a good fit.

He has really impressed me and won me over. He looks like he's happy to be playing ball now, too.\n\nI remember all the negativity when he came, talking about his \"bad attitude\" and all, but I'm thinking that maybe it wasn't Melo or *his* attitude that were the problem there...", "Hes done well when I wasnt sure he would, I wish he would defer when hes shooting cold though but thats just Mamba mentality lol gotta take bad with the good", "Melo hasn\u2019t been worth talking about since he was in Denver. Bum!", "Lol yeah obviously nobody is talking about the Thunder\u2019s little turnaround...... /s", "Before Melo got to OKC I was firmly in the take him or leave him group. Didn't think he could provide much of a difference because of his style of play. (Iso ball, sub-par defense) But man, have I been pleasantly proven wrong in the last 4-6 weeks. He is becoming the Olympic Melo for us and damn is it fun to watch him. And like you said, he could drop 40 on anybody and I cant wait for that game this year. ", "All this for sure, but what surprises me most is he's an amazing locker room guy! The team chemistry is awesome and he's a big part of that. I love how excited he is for his teammates during games and how he's mentoring guys like TFerg etc. It's just awesome seeing happy Melo having so much fun playing again. He's constantly laughing or smiling on the court.

Usually Stars who haven\u2019t won a ring yet (sometimes they have) always jump ship at the end of their career to win more. Malone. D wade. Barkley etc.\n\nIve always liked Melos game but he isn\u2019t sacrificing much joining a team that usually makes it to the WCF... and added a top 15-10 guy.\n\nI\u2019m not hating on him for joining an already very good team as Coach Herm says \u201cyou play to win the game\u201d and winning is fun but to say he deserves some accolade for his play on a stacked team is a stretch.", "Honestly his game hasnt evolved too much when the knicks were contending in the eastern conference the effort was always there it was the tank teams that he gave up on. He loves to compete though ", "I don't think it was just coaches that overused his ISO ability - if you watched NY after our 2nd seed year you'd see every single player other than maybe KP just pass the ball to Melo and give up every time we lost momentum in a game or had a play break down. Once Felton, Shump, and JR turned to shit and we lost Chandler, our only real choice was Melo iso.

Only coverage I\u2019ve seen recently is over the Embiid Westgoat beef. People are heavily sleeping on the Thunder right now...  Even when we are talked about they rank OKC behind GSW, HOU, and Twolves even tho we\u2019ve beaten all of them. \n\nThat\u2019s fine tho, last time OKC got slept in we took the best regular season record team of all time to 7 games and almost won, and that was with a snake.

At peak Dad-Melo in 2015-16 he was averaging over 4 assists a game. And all of his iso-shots were the results of a succession of unimaginative coaches who drew up those plays for lack of any better ideas or better players to pass the ball to. Guy is a legend, and I miss watching him play on my team.\n\nSuper excited to see him in the playoffs this year. Go Thunder.", "I was definitely on the fence when get got here, but now I would love to resign him. I don't know what he would be looking for in a long term deal if he opts out, but something like 4/65 seems reasonable. Some team would definitely sign him to more, but maybe his happiness here would help us get him at a discount.", "Stay Me7o my friends.", "imo, I don't think anyone was demanding shots the first few weeks.  It just felt like all 3 players were looking to keep a 20ppg average...and that's not how ideally work out.  Melo made the sacrifice to go down to 17ppg so George could go up to 22ppg and Westbrook 25ppg.  ONE of them was going to have to take a backseat.", "I would say I\u2019m guilty of fully watching Melo with the Knicks. Although I definitely tuned in.

Don't pretend like you're under the radar.", "i think everyone was demanding shots. and like u say, one player had to take the backseat. and being on a team with two all-stars in their prime (melo being an all-star, but undoubtably past his prime), it was always going to be melo who had to step down.\n\nhe deserves some credit for putting his ego aside, but it was the right decision, as i'm sure he's aware. ", "Furthermore, we all know sometimes we get mad at our teammates when they start sucking and just take the rock. I think any competitive person in the world would do that, team first or not. Melo has definitely done that on occasion, but so has literally every other star in NBA history. Except, when he did it, it was a problem.", "Houston can't get OKC out of their mouth. We know this.

Shots just weren't falling.  But Melo was the one averaging 22-24ppg on 43%-47%.  The other two were around 20ppg and 39%-40% shooting.  So, to see that the other two succeeded more, the took a backseat to 17ppg.  IMO, I feel all 3 at some point were going start shooting well, even without someone taking a backseat.
