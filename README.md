## Instructions 

### Setting up PRAW

Install PIP if you haven't done so already. 

I installed it on mac and this video helped: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioZoC8_Hk7o

After installing PIP, type "Pip install PRAW" in the terminal.

You should be good to go after doing so. 


### Reddit
Create Reddit account (if haven't done so already)

Go to the following link: https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/

Click on "Create an APP".

Select "Script" 

Put anything for desciption, name, and URL (a URL to google could work).

After creating the app, 

client id will be the code on the line under where it says "peronal use script"

client sectret is the code next to "secret"

Copy and paste id and secret into locations in crawler.py file
